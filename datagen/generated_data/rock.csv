Verse 1:

I'm on the edge of a broken dream
My soul's in flames, my heart's not free
I'm searching for a way to make it right
But I'm too blind to see the light

Chorus:

I'm gonna take my stand, I'm gonna fight
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna find the strength to carry on
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right

Verse 2:

I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so low
My pain's been growing, I just can't let go
I'm reaching for a way to make it right
But I'm too weak to stand the fight

Chorus:

I'm gonna take my stand, I'm gonna fight
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna find the strength to carry on
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right

Bridge:

My will is strong, I'm ready to go
I'm gonna take control, I'm gonna make it show
I'm gonna find a way to make it right
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right

Chorus:

I'm gonna take my stand, I'm gonna fight
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna find the strength to carry on
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right",rock

Verse 1

I'm standing here in the dark
My heart is heavy and my soul is torn apart
I'm searching for something to free me from this pain
But all I can find is a broken, empty frame

Chorus

I'm lost in the night, I'm lost in the fight
I'm searching for something that'll make it alright
But I'm just a man, I'm no superman
I'm just trying to find my way back home again

Verse 2

I'm holding on to a hope that I can't see
I'm trying to make it through this misery
My dreams have all been shattered and my future's so unclear
But I'm still standing here, I'm still standing here

Chorus

I'm lost in the night, I'm lost in the fight
I'm searching for something that'll make it alright
But I'm just a man, I'm no superman
I'm just trying to find my way back home again

Bridge

There's a voice inside me saying don't give up
It's telling me I can make it through this tough
So I'm gonna keep on fighting, keep on believing
That I can find my way back home again

Chorus

I'm lost in the night, I'm lost in the fight
I'm searching for something that'll make it alright
But I'm just a man, I'm no superman
I'm just trying to find my way back home again",rock

I'm feeling like I'm in a race
My mind is spinning round and round
I'm pushing through this crazy maze
But I won't let myself drown
