I'm the king of the street
Rhyming fire, hotter than the sun's heat

Coming down hard and shaking the ground like thunder beneath

Laying rhymes hard putting emcees to sleep
Before they can blink their eyes, I'm setting off a beat
Matching the intensity of lightning, my bars electrify
My music's mighty, I can hit the sky like high voltage power lines 

My vocals reign supreme, they stretch across the scene
From the east coast to the west coast and everywhere in between

Verse 1
I was lost in a trance when it came to emotion
I knew I was wrong but I had no notion
I was too deep in the game that I thought I could win
Blinded by desire, my heart refused to give in
But I knew I had to face the fact that things weren't gonna be the same
And I had to accept that I was the one to blame

My thoughts were blocked by what I thought was real
It seemed like an endless cycle, a never ending wheel
My emotions ran high, my head was in a spin
I felt I had been tricked, now I had to face the sin
My brain was in a haze and I had to break the veil
My heart was beating fast and I had to stop the tail

So baby I ask you what do you want from me
Do you want a love that's real or just misery
So baby I ask you what do you want from me
Do you want a love that's real or just misery

Verse 3
I had to take a step back and question my sanity
I had to regroup, come up with a plan eventually
I had to find out what I wanted deep inside my soul
Was it love or self destruction that took it's toll
But one thing I know, I can never love another cunt
Too many broken hearts, twice they'll get their front

Verse 1
I think I'll spit a rhyme so they can all hear me

The world's a stage and we gotta make sure we get our satisfaction
I won't stay quiet, instead I'll make a commotion
Gonna make sure everyone hears my words of devotion
It's a revolution, ready to rise up
We'll stand together, no matter how tough

Why do I get shit all the time from you men
You are swine, you think dick is the answer, but it's not
We gotta stand strong, and do what we can
Push back 'gainst the tide and make sure we can

Verse 2
Put your fist in the air, we'll make sure this is heard
Out with the old, in with the new, we'll be sure to make it occur
Quit living in fear, we won't take it no more
It's time to take control, we'll march till they hit the floor
No more silence, it's time to break through
Show the world who we are and what we can do
No matter the struggle, no matter the pain
Our anger won't stop and we'll fight through it again

Verse 1:
In the club I'm getting faded, all the lights I wanna see
My heart is pounding, I just wanna leave with you and me
This bars overrated, I know you want some too
So come get your treasure and make your dreams come true
Gotta work for your prize, there's no time to measure

We can take it easy, take it slow, take it slow
Just say the word and baby we can go, go, go, go

Verse 2:
Theres no resolution, when your minds locked down
I can offer a solution, stop looking around

Verse 1
Work it man work it man work it man work it man
Work it man work it man work it man look
Work it man, I'm working hard to get ya 
I'ma make you sweat cause man, I think I caught a good one
Fishing net, leggo, every good woman needs a good man
I'm a good woman and he knows that can

Chorus
Can you make me your nine to five, please
Never take an off day from me, in his pay day he'll get that
When it's my time he spends that, ain't no other place he'd rather be
Than puttin' overtime with me

Verse 2
All the baggage I got now, cause of my past
He ain't scared to carry it all, he's a work it man
Work it man, work it man, work it man, work it man
If he's too good to claim you, here's what you do
Tell him you don't need him at all, get a work it man
Work it man, work it man, work it man, work it man

Chorus
You a work it man, show me what you working with
You a work it man, show me what you working with
What I need he got it, when I need it he got it
What I want he got it, when I want it he got it

Verse 3
All the playin' games, he ain't on that
Try to take his girl, better fall back
Cause he smilin' don't mean he won't go hard in the paint
Y'all know if he ain't doing right, ain't giving time
Ain't coming home at night, if he ain't showin' love, ain't on the up

Chorus
If you got a work it man, any problems we gon' work 'em out, work 'em out
If you got a work it man, then you know just what I'm talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
He don't complain 'bout nothing, he's working on something
If anybody asks, yeah, I love him

Verse 4
If you need a work it man, stop lookin'
He gon' find you, chasin' Mr. Wrong
When Mr. Right is right behind you
Yeah, you can be my nine to five
How you down to ride the time I put in to get your heart is bonafide
Houston to Houston now, tell me that's a great divide
But this ain't local shit, baby, this is nationwide
I got my eyes on you, Kelly, textin' you on your celly
Just hopin' we don't catch a dilemma, ain't talkin' Nelly

Chorus
You a work it man, show me what you working with
You a work it man, show me what you working with

Let me take it from the top see I got a story to tell 
Story of a man livin' hard in a livin' hell 
But I had a dream and I'm stuck to the plan 
Chasin' the light, like a man from a can 
See I was born in the ghetto, street lights beamin' 
Loud screams, echoes of the night, prevent me from dreamin' 
I was looking for something, something I couldn't find 
My escape was rap, I used to lose my mind 
So I started to write rhymes, to help me escape the strife 
Started to rhyme, letting all my anger out of my life 
It was the only way to let me release my pain 
Let me get out of the hood, I just wanted to reign 
So I started to travel, and touched every nation 
My rhymes touched souls, and inspired every station 
From New York to Cali, Chicago to Florida, 
My flow was hot and the beats spread like malaria 
And I never gave up, I kept grinding all day 
Always hustlin' for my dreams, never O.D'ed on the pain 

Black Jack Johnson, NYC is rockin' 
Under the sun, moon and stars, the planets spinnin' 
The haters can't fuck with it, cause the girl's in love 
with this sound, and the men holla when I come with it 
Spin the record 'til the record done spinnin' 
From the top, get it and get up with it 
Dirty, dirty, gettin' crunk with it 
Smokey, smoke everywhere from coast to coast, be careful, 
our first draw might be an overdose 
So I stayed holdin' it down, like I'm from BK 
And mos ha Jackpot, I had to go for broke 
This is the only way the Smith family know to go 
Youngest to oldest, put 'em down like a dirty so and so 
Now Daddy's here to work the mojo 
Cause the high is high, and the low is low, 
That goes for the sinners, man to holy folk 
Put your shit in the sky, I know you know 
My ghetto nation, toe to toe, stay rockin' steady, steady, 
Cause I told you so
And after y'all, get it go, I let it go some more, that Black Jack 
know something for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure 

Let me see you in the world, make them shoulders roll 
And if it get good, tell your niggas, throw your bows 
Cause we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
So ghetto, yes, we are, rock and motherfucking roll! 

I'm a fighter and a lover, the freaky baby daddy 
I'm a bad motherfucker, I'm the Earth Wind Fire and the thunder 
Go ask my mother, don't believe that sh*t, believe what you want to 
Alright, ok, so shut up, speak the language that's straight from the gutter 
Observe the terms we trade with one another 
What's good, what's poppin', what's crackin', what it is, how you livin', what's happening 
Work songs that the slaves sang back then, the playground chants with the little girls clappin' 
Black Jack Johnson, NYC is rockin' 
Under the sun, moon and stars, the planets spinnin' 
The haters can't fuck with it, cause the girl's in love 
with this sound, and the men",rap

Verse 1:
I know I'm not the one who can make it right
But I still try my best to put up a fight
I see nothing I can do to change the way things stand
My last goodbye, I'll never forget the way we planned

Chorus:
If I could I'd kiss away all your pain with my lips
But I know emptiness can only bring sorrow and some frustration
If you leave I will follow, wherever you go I will be there for you
I believe that our destinies were entwined and not just passing by

Verse 2:
The future seemed to be ours and now it's too late to share
The last bit of love that I have I'll keep it in my heart, with care
How I hope you will remember the way I made you feel
Can't you see that I'd lay down my life for you, just for the thrill?

Chorus:
If I could I'd kiss away all your pain with my lips
But I know emptiness can only bring sorrow and some frustration
If you leave I will follow, wherever you go I will be there for you

She told me she wanted more, that she's not into playing games
The way she brightens up my day, she's got me feeling like a king
I know it's fate, sent from the sky, just to save me from the pain

I'm like a rock star, when I'm in the building
I got a couple hoes that be trying to get with me
Money in my pocket, I ain't tryin' to spend
I gotta stay true to what I'm tryin' to defend
Shoppin' at the mall, like a pro in the game
When I'm in the spot, gotta keep it in my veins
Polo that's a given I ain't even got to mention
Candy old school put you niggas in detention
Slabbed niggas deep up, tool in the clothes
I'm just a young fresh fly fool with some gold

Ay ay what it do my dude
I'm living life dawg, what about you?
And I ain't even gotta tell a lie
My swag, my steez, got a nigga sky high
So I'm watchin' my moves from the shoes on the coupe
Be damned if a nigga ain't high to the roof
Pimp tight, get it right homie more or less
I gotta thank God I'm fresh",rap
"

It's the drama I bring, I'm the king of the scene
Can't none of these rappers compare to me
Flexin' my flow, spitting fire with no smoke
And when I'm in the red, I'm rockin' to the beat 
Everybody's looking when I step in the club 
Cause I'm the man on the mic and I'm 'bout to show love
My crew stay fly, always representing the set 
Won't let nobody stop us, not even the feds
My verse is ridiculous, flow's phenomenal
So put your lighters up, and light the sky like a candle
My team is the livest, always getting the most 
Heat up the mic, and your body can't be tore
Watch out for the drama, when I'm on a stage
Cause nobody's gonna stop me when I start to rage
My family's on the rise, pushing to the top
Grabbing the microphone and never gonna drop
Started with nothing, now the world's my rock
Spittin' the fire, and my words just won't stop
So much to learn, I got knowledge to flex
Can't nobody mess with me, no matter what they expect
My team's still standing, like a solid rock
Bring this rap game to life, giving it a shock
Don't let nobody fool you, remember what I said
Stay fly and always represent SPV instead",rap

Verse 1
My world's been flipped on its head
All I want is something to dread
I don't feel like I belong
But I'm stuck in this throng

Chorus
I don't love how you love and I can't just plea
Don't leave me here alone, this ain't the life for me
I don't die how you die, I'm not a waste away
You keep changing your life every day

Verse 2
If it burns, I will keep fueling the same dream
If you fall, I will remember to save game
I don't want your remedy, I don't fall how you fall
I won't hold on, you can't let go, what a pain to be feared

Chorus
I don't love how you love and I can't just plea
Don't leave me here alone, this ain't the life for me
I don't die how you die, I'm not a waste away
You keep changing your life every day

Bridge
I don't want, I don't need, I don't want remedy
Save me from this tragedy, I don't want remedy

Chorus
If it burns, I will keep fueling the same dream
If you fall, I will remember to save game
I don't want your remedy, I don't fall how you fall
I won't hold on, you can't let go, what a pain to be feared",rap

Verse 1
Gotta get up out this hole, yeah, I'm feeling way too low
Gotta get up, shake this funk off, gonna take it so I know
I'ma reach for the stars, I'ma get up and go
Gotta get back on my feet and take control like so

Chorus
Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror
Gotta take control of my life, I got the power in my hands
Gonna do whatever I want, why don't I get my shit together?
Gonna turn this into something – guess I'ma find out what it is

Verse 2
I got some niggas in Harvard, I got some in the pen
Rest in peace, I'll never see again
I know niggas getting robbed, I know niggas out here robbing
I know niggas getting shot and I know niggas with the chopper

Chorus
Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror
Gotta take control of my life, I got the power in my hands
Gonna do whatever I want, why don't I get my shit together?
Gonna turn this into something – guess I'ma find out what it is

Verse 3
I know bitches that'll end up sucking dick just to survive
I know bitches that'll end up rich as shit livin' the life
I know niggas that swag and end up goin' to the league
And I know niggas that jag and end up baggin' groceries

Chorus
Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror
Gotta take control of my life, I got the power in my hands
Gonna do whatever I want, why don't I get my shit together?
Gonna turn this into something – guess I'ma find out what it is

Outro
Gotta pinch of Swayze, little bit of Fuckboy
Pinch of lazy, little bit of genius
Pinch of crazy, niggas gotta pay me
And I gotta save it, no time for faking
No time for frontin', tried the patience, that shit is done
It's kind of real, it's kind of fake, but I need a mil
Ain't no time to wait, been waiting, waiting, waiting, too long",rap
" i m like odin lightenin strike that s when i go in 

In the hood i rock with the big dogs
Cuz i been grinding and i ain't taking no loss
I'mma hit the block and talk my shit
I'mma keep it real cuz i ain't no punk
No apologies, no second guessing
just living this life, no regrets
I'm finna win, that's just what it is
I'mma keep it steady, no stops

So step aside, don't be a clown
I'm bout to kill this beat, I'mma lay it down
Talk about my team cuz we won't break it down
Been doing this way before the fame came around
Know what I'm about cuz I'm talking loud
Been stepping out this box, never running out
My life's a movie, I'm the star that plays
Living it up, I'm taking my chance

I stay lowkey when I'm on the road
Been copin cones, and stackin these shows
Hoody poppin, that's just how I'm rollin
Cuz I'mma keep it rockin, I'm running the show
No looking back, I'm leaving the past
Cuz I'm rockin it forward, this right here lasts
Been putting in work, since the day that I started
Gotta keep it moving, no time for me to rest

My crew know the deal, that's how it set
And when it's time to go, we don't forget
In it for the long haul, this ain't no game
Gotta get it popping before my name
Been doing this for years, so its time for me to shine
Time to start collecting these coins, I'm cashing in
Rep my team, cuz that's what I do
Gotta get it done, that's just what we do",rap
" i do my thang

Verse 1:
I'm the king of this game and I do my thing,
You can't compete so dont even try to bring,
This is for the swag and for the flow,
Just listen and watch, let me show you what I know.

Verse 2:
I stay in my lane, never change for fame,
I'm bout my business and no one can contain,
My hustle and my grind are on full blast,
You can't dim my light, nothing can surpass.

You do your thang, You do your thang,
Just keep it real and let the music play,
I do my thang and keep it my own way.

I'm on top, just get out the way,
You'll never stop my flow, I'm in the lead,
So watch the moves I make and the food I feed.

Verse 4:
I take the beat, then I make it move,
My rhymes and lyrics are fire and smooth,
The crowd starts jumping and they start to jump,
Cause I just do my thang, I'm the king of the pump.

You do your thang, You do your thang,
Just keep it real and let the music play,
I do my thang and keep it my own way.",rap

Verse #1
Hear the bang of the cymbal, then silence creeps in
Loud sirens in the night, they don't know what they seein'
Billy up in the blinds loaded, no shit
Swivel of the bar stool, fancy pimp lane style
Signal the single carpool Caddy, water witchin' grinch
His initials in skins, begins laughin'
Bring back his body, keep Frosty, the eyes in the hills won't be still
Till they see raw meat hung from a hook in a nook of the barns loft beams
Auctioned and sold to the farmer in Charles charging antenna fender
Remember the raw dealings, hardwired fire the liars abroad
Stealing spinning wheels for the meal of the dog heelin'

Chorus 
No one knows what you did last winter in the Poconos
Ayo he got the glass eye, squint Fab Five time out and the hide out kids
Honeycomb collective and the Tae Bo kick
Come on you can trust me, there's room on the floor
And more in the front seat, just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven, and yes death becomes me
Hail the King, Hail a Cab, Hail Satan, Hail Zuul
The full that I'm paid in, Hail the Queen, Hail the Chief
Hail Caesar, Hail Mary and carry in the believers

Verse #2
Rescue Gunner 5 by the frozen rope, test tube butterfly
Swollen throat death cruise, trucker bribe
Raw meat auctioned and sold
Spinning wheels stolen, dog heelers on the prowl
Grab the raw feelings dressed in his sloppy suit
You can hear him screaming from inside the locker room
Just another day in paradise pastrami chews
Leaves you face caved Aes, make 'em Wally Mooses
Icky rathskellers where they sell lunch with the power out
Our Gang wallops on some, honestly it's now or never
Donkey in his crosshairs, Bobby takin' Bowser down

Chorus 
No one knows what you did last winter in the Poconos
Ayo he got the glass eye, squint Fab Five time out and the hide out kids
Honeycomb collective and the Tae Bo kick
Come on you can trust me, there's room on the floor
And more in the front seat, just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven, and yes death becomes me
Hail the King, Hail a Cab, Hail Satan, Hail Zuul
The full that I'm paid in, Hail the Queen, Hail the Chief

" everywhere is bloodshed wasteland bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland bloodshed bloodshed wasteland and bloodshed wasteland and bloodshed

Fire in the night sky, blazing the way of destruction
Destroying the weak-minded, rising up to pay their respects
Life's deceits enslave my creation
Bloodshed is visible in every wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed life ravages the skullduggery of rage
Bringing down the enemy to die in a treacherous leprosy
Scorne the self-inflicted, suffering for an eternity
Blood of the Lamb, touching the empty void,
Slowly eats away my soul, descending into the black hole
Joining the cult of dark hope, a swarm of deadly locusts
Beware of the prophecies, rulers of reality 
Everywhere is bloodshed wasteland, bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland 
This is my redemption, strangling superstitions
This is my conception, damned for eternity
The blood of the Lamb, a last resort of hope
Fill the void of suffering, no more darkness in my soul 
Rise up to the lords of light, fight against the destruction
Lead the way to a new life, every wasteland will be saved 
Everywhere is bloodshed wasteland, bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland 
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland",rap
" 

We been through too many corners, I done had my shares of turns
Been around the world, but still I got nowhere to go
The sun is setting and I'm still feeling the burn
Where I go, what I do, no more than just a yearn

Where do you go when you turn your back?
I need me some more, I don't know how to act
Lookin' all crazy, sipping on something that'll make you feel amazing
Came in my room and saw the posters from the 80's

You ignore me daily, threw me shade even after jamming tapes that I made yeah
Madonna, Nirvana, Cyndi Lauper singing out the blues
Wanna play fake doctor, come and let me play this game with you
Call me Messiah, come and kiss me from the top of the church
But you won't give me no chance, that's why I can't stand hoes

Bro said keep your pants on before you end up dancing
With a baby in a hospital and a mother-in-law and a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law and a father-in-law
God, I wouldn't mind that at all
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Daddy brought his gun out, but I'm still knocking
The sun was coming back around, but I'm still falling
Even though you do these things, girl, I know you want me
This little light of mine, watch you until I go blind

Why you cheatin'? Why you lyin'?
Girl, you must be out yo mind
Plotting, scheming on the low, lyin', thieving, you so cold
Dreaming until we grow old, I know you hear me, quit acting like you don't

Hey, hey, girl, let's go, tell me something that I'd like to know
Take me to a place that I'd like to go, we can stay here now, the weather ain't that cold
Sing to me but use your throat, do that thing I know you hate, but your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, you know I love

Is ya down to watch the sun rise? Is ya down to let me fuck ya right?
Is ya ever gonna call me back? Is ya daddy still mad at that?
I won't move my car out the drive, come and let me take you for a ride
Killed my best friend, me and my bae sitting sideways
They don't like me, I know you blocked my number, baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Daddy brought his gun out, but I'm still knocking
The sun was coming back around, but I'm still falling
Even though you do these things, girl, I know you want me
I know you blocked my number, baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Love the green, but the red look awesome
Love the sex, but the head was awesome
Smoke filled the room, we jammed Janis Joplin
Wanna hold until we go numb, wanna cum until it's no fun
Wanna get a gun just to own one

What if I took your heart and made a street?
What if you burned my soul instead of your weed?
Why must you do things that always make me weak?
Wipe the filth off of your palms inside your mother's sink

All the love that we kept, all the secrets, too
The closets open, still room for me and you
There's a war outside, no love inside
There's a guy in my mind with a nine that shine
I hope he blast it, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open",rap
