I'm the king of the street
Rhyming fire, hotter than the sun's heat

Coming down hard and shaking the ground like thunder beneath

Laying rhymes hard putting emcees to sleep
Before they can blink their eyes, I'm setting off a beat
Matching the intensity of lightning, my bars electrify
My music's mighty, I can hit the sky like high voltage power lines 

My vocals reign supreme, they stretch across the scene
From the east coast to the west coast and everywhere in between

Verse 1
I was lost in a trance when it came to emotion
I knew I was wrong but I had no notion
I was too deep in the game that I thought I could win
Blinded by desire, my heart refused to give in
But I knew I had to face the fact that things weren't gonna be the same
And I had to accept that I was the one to blame

My thoughts were blocked by what I thought was real
It seemed like an endless cycle, a never ending wheel
My emotions ran high, my head was in a spin
I felt I had been tricked, now I had to face the sin
My brain was in a haze and I had to break the veil
My heart was beating fast and I had to stop the tail

So baby I ask you what do you want from me
Do you want a love that's real or just misery
So baby I ask you what do you want from me
Do you want a love that's real or just misery

Verse 3
I had to take a step back and question my sanity
I had to regroup, come up with a plan eventually
I had to find out what I wanted deep inside my soul
Was it love or self destruction that took it's toll
But one thing I know, I can never love another cunt
Too many broken hearts, twice they'll get their front

Verse 1
I think I'll spit a rhyme so they can all hear me

The world's a stage and we gotta make sure we get our satisfaction
I won't stay quiet, instead I'll make a commotion
Gonna make sure everyone hears my words of devotion
It's a revolution, ready to rise up
We'll stand together, no matter how tough

Why do I get shit all the time from you men
You are swine, you think dick is the answer, but it's not
We gotta stand strong, and do what we can
Push back 'gainst the tide and make sure we can

Verse 2
Put your fist in the air, we'll make sure this is heard
Out with the old, in with the new, we'll be sure to make it occur
Quit living in fear, we won't take it no more
It's time to take control, we'll march till they hit the floor
No more silence, it's time to break through
Show the world who we are and what we can do
No matter the struggle, no matter the pain
Our anger won't stop and we'll fight through it again

Verse 1:
In the club I'm getting faded, all the lights I wanna see
My heart is pounding, I just wanna leave with you and me
This bars overrated, I know you want some too
So come get your treasure and make your dreams come true
Gotta work for your prize, there's no time to measure

We can take it easy, take it slow, take it slow
Just say the word and baby we can go, go, go, go

Verse 2:
Theres no resolution, when your minds locked down
I can offer a solution, stop looking around

Verse 1
Work it man work it man work it man work it man
Work it man work it man work it man look
Work it man, I'm working hard to get ya 
I'ma make you sweat cause man, I think I caught a good one
Fishing net, leggo, every good woman needs a good man
I'm a good woman and he knows that can

Chorus
Can you make me your nine to five, please
Never take an off day from me, in his pay day he'll get that
When it's my time he spends that, ain't no other place he'd rather be
Than puttin' overtime with me

Verse 2
All the baggage I got now, cause of my past
He ain't scared to carry it all, he's a work it man
Work it man, work it man, work it man, work it man
If he's too good to claim you, here's what you do
Tell him you don't need him at all, get a work it man
Work it man, work it man, work it man, work it man

Chorus
You a work it man, show me what you working with
You a work it man, show me what you working with
What I need he got it, when I need it he got it
What I want he got it, when I want it he got it

Verse 3
All the playin' games, he ain't on that
Try to take his girl, better fall back
Cause he smilin' don't mean he won't go hard in the paint
Y'all know if he ain't doing right, ain't giving time
Ain't coming home at night, if he ain't showin' love, ain't on the up

Chorus
If you got a work it man, any problems we gon' work 'em out, work 'em out
If you got a work it man, then you know just what I'm talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
He don't complain 'bout nothing, he's working on something
If anybody asks, yeah, I love him

Verse 4
If you need a work it man, stop lookin'
He gon' find you, chasin' Mr. Wrong
When Mr. Right is right behind you
Yeah, you can be my nine to five
How you down to ride the time I put in to get your heart is bonafide
Houston to Houston now, tell me that's a great divide
But this ain't local shit, baby, this is nationwide
I got my eyes on you, Kelly, textin' you on your celly
Just hopin' we don't catch a dilemma, ain't talkin' Nelly

Chorus
You a work it man, show me what you working with
You a work it man, show me what you working with

Let me take it from the top see I got a story to tell 
Story of a man livin' hard in a livin' hell 
But I had a dream and I'm stuck to the plan 
Chasin' the light, like a man from a can 
See I was born in the ghetto, street lights beamin' 
Loud screams, echoes of the night, prevent me from dreamin' 
I was looking for something, something I couldn't find 
My escape was rap, I used to lose my mind 
So I started to write rhymes, to help me escape the strife 
Started to rhyme, letting all my anger out of my life 
It was the only way to let me release my pain 
Let me get out of the hood, I just wanted to reign 
So I started to travel, and touched every nation 
My rhymes touched souls, and inspired every station 
From New York to Cali, Chicago to Florida, 
My flow was hot and the beats spread like malaria 
And I never gave up, I kept grinding all day 
Always hustlin' for my dreams, never O.D'ed on the pain 

Black Jack Johnson, NYC is rockin' 
Under the sun, moon and stars, the planets spinnin' 
The haters can't fuck with it, cause the girl's in love 
with this sound, and the men holla when I come with it 
Spin the record 'til the record done spinnin' 
From the top, get it and get up with it 
Dirty, dirty, gettin' crunk with it 
Smokey, smoke everywhere from coast to coast, be careful, 
our first draw might be an overdose 
So I stayed holdin' it down, like I'm from BK 
And mos ha Jackpot, I had to go for broke 
This is the only way the Smith family know to go 
Youngest to oldest, put 'em down like a dirty so and so 
Now Daddy's here to work the mojo 
Cause the high is high, and the low is low, 
That goes for the sinners, man to holy folk 
Put your shit in the sky, I know you know 
My ghetto nation, toe to toe, stay rockin' steady, steady, 
Cause I told you so
And after y'all, get it go, I let it go some more, that Black Jack 
know something for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure 

Let me see you in the world, make them shoulders roll 
And if it get good, tell your niggas, throw your bows 
Cause we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
So ghetto, yes, we are, rock and motherfucking roll! 

I'm a fighter and a lover, the freaky baby daddy 
I'm a bad motherfucker, I'm the Earth Wind Fire and the thunder 
Go ask my mother, don't believe that sh*t, believe what you want to 
Alright, ok, so shut up, speak the language that's straight from the gutter 
Observe the terms we trade with one another 
What's good, what's poppin', what's crackin', what it is, how you livin', what's happening 
Work songs that the slaves sang back then, the playground chants with the little girls clappin' 
Black Jack Johnson, NYC is rockin' 
Under the sun, moon and stars, the planets spinnin' 
The haters can't fuck with it, cause the girl's in love 
with this sound, and the men",rap

Verse 1:
I know I'm not the one who can make it right
But I still try my best to put up a fight
I see nothing I can do to change the way things stand
My last goodbye, I'll never forget the way we planned

Chorus:
If I could I'd kiss away all your pain with my lips
But I know emptiness can only bring sorrow and some frustration
If you leave I will follow, wherever you go I will be there for you
I believe that our destinies were entwined and not just passing by

Verse 2:
The future seemed to be ours and now it's too late to share
The last bit of love that I have I'll keep it in my heart, with care
How I hope you will remember the way I made you feel
Can't you see that I'd lay down my life for you, just for the thrill?

Chorus:
If I could I'd kiss away all your pain with my lips
But I know emptiness can only bring sorrow and some frustration
If you leave I will follow, wherever you go I will be there for you

She told me she wanted more, that she's not into playing games
The way she brightens up my day, she's got me feeling like a king
I know it's fate, sent from the sky, just to save me from the pain

I'm like a rock star, when I'm in the building
I got a couple hoes that be trying to get with me
Money in my pocket, I ain't tryin' to spend
I gotta stay true to what I'm tryin' to defend
Shoppin' at the mall, like a pro in the game
When I'm in the spot, gotta keep it in my veins
Polo that's a given I ain't even got to mention
Candy old school put you niggas in detention
Slabbed niggas deep up, tool in the clothes
I'm just a young fresh fly fool with some gold

Ay ay what it do my dude
I'm living life dawg, what about you?
And I ain't even gotta tell a lie
My swag, my steez, got a nigga sky high
So I'm watchin' my moves from the shoes on the coupe
Be damned if a nigga ain't high to the roof
Pimp tight, get it right homie more or less
I gotta thank God I'm fresh",rap

It's the drama I bring, I'm the king of the scene
Can't none of these rappers compare to me
Flexin' my flow, spitting fire with no smoke
And when I'm in the red, I'm rockin' to the beat 
Everybody's looking when I step in the club 
Cause I'm the man on the mic and I'm 'bout to show love
My crew stay fly, always representing the set 
Won't let nobody stop us, not even the feds
My verse is ridiculous, flow's phenomenal
So put your lighters up, and light the sky like a candle
My team is the livest, always getting the most 
Heat up the mic, and your body can't be tore
Watch out for the drama, when I'm on a stage
Cause nobody's gonna stop me when I start to rage
My family's on the rise, pushing to the top
Grabbing the microphone and never gonna drop
Started with nothing, now the world's my rock
Spittin' the fire, and my words just won't stop
So much to learn, I got knowledge to flex
Can't nobody mess with me, no matter what they expect
My team's still standing, like a solid rock
Bring this rap game to life, giving it a shock
Don't let nobody fool you, remember what I said
Stay fly and always represent SPV instead",rap

All I want is something to dread
I don't feel like I belong
But I'm stuck in this throng

Chorus

Don't leave me here alone, this ain't the life for me
I don't die how you die, I'm not a waste away

Verse 2
If it burns, I will keep fueling the same dream
If you fall, I will remember to save game
I don't want your remedy, I don't fall how you fall
I won't hold on, you can't let go, what a pain to be feared

Chorus

Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror

Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror

Gotta pinch of Swayze, little bit of Fuckboy
Pinch of lazy, little bit of genius
Pinch of crazy, niggas gotta pay me
And I gotta save it, no time for faking

Been stepping out this box, never running out

Living it up, I'm taking my chance

Been copin cones, and stackin these shows
Hoody poppin, that's just how I'm rollin
Cuz I'mma keep it rockin, I'm running the show
No looking back, I'm leaving the past
Cuz I'm rockin it forward, this right here lasts
Been putting in work, since the day that I started
Gotta keep it moving, no time for me to rest

My crew know the deal, that's how it set
And when it's time to go, we don't forget
In it for the long haul, this ain't no game
Gotta get it popping before my name
Been doing this for years, so its time for me to shine
Time to start collecting these coins, I'm cashing in
Rep my team, cuz that's what I do
Gotta get it done, that's just what we do",rap

Verse #1
Hear the bang of the cymbal, then silence creeps in
Loud sirens in the night, they don't know what they seein'
Billy up in the blinds loaded, no shit
Swivel of the bar stool, fancy pimp lane style
Signal the single carpool Caddy, water witchin' grinch
His initials in skins, begins laughin'
Bring back his body, keep Frosty, the eyes in the hills won't be still
Till they see raw meat hung from a hook in a nook of the barns loft beams
Auctioned and sold to the farmer in Charles charging antenna fender
Remember the raw dealings, hardwired fire the liars abroad
Stealing spinning wheels for the meal of the dog heelin'

Chorus 
No one knows what you did last winter in the Poconos
Ayo he got the glass eye, squint Fab Five time out and the hide out kids
Honeycomb collective and the Tae Bo kick
Come on you can trust me, there's room on the floor
And more in the front seat, just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven, and yes death becomes me
Hail the King, Hail a Cab, Hail Satan, Hail Zuul
The full that I'm paid in, Hail the Queen, Hail the Chief
Hail Caesar, Hail Mary and carry in the believers

Verse #2
Rescue Gunner 5 by the frozen rope, test tube butterfly
Swollen throat death cruise, trucker bribe
Raw meat auctioned and sold
Spinning wheels stolen, dog heelers on the prowl
Grab the raw feelings dressed in his sloppy suit
You can hear him screaming from inside the locker room
Just another day in paradise pastrami chews
Leaves you face caved Aes, make 'em Wally Mooses
Icky rathskellers where they sell lunch with the power out
Our Gang wallops on some, honestly it's now or never
Donkey in his crosshairs, Bobby takin' Bowser down

" everywhere is bloodshed wasteland bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland bloodshed bloodshed wasteland and bloodshed wasteland and bloodshed

Fire in the night sky, blazing the way of destruction
Destroying the weak-minded, rising up to pay their respects
Life's deceits enslave my creation
Bloodshed is visible in every wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed life ravages the skullduggery of rage
Bringing down the enemy to die in a treacherous leprosy
Scorne the self-inflicted, suffering for an eternity
Blood of the Lamb, touching the empty void,
Slowly eats away my soul, descending into the black hole
Joining the cult of dark hope, a swarm of deadly locusts
Beware of the prophecies, rulers of reality 
Everywhere is bloodshed wasteland, bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland 
This is my redemption, strangling superstitions
This is my conception, damned for eternity
The blood of the Lamb, a last resort of hope
Fill the void of suffering, no more darkness in my soul 
Rise up to the lords of light, fight against the destruction
Lead the way to a new life, every wasteland will be saved 
Everywhere is bloodshed wasteland, bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland 
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland",rap

We been through too many corners, I done had my shares of turns
Been around the world, but still I got nowhere to go
The sun is setting and I'm still feeling the burn
Where I go, what I do, no more than just a yearn

Where do you go when you turn your back?
I need me some more, I don't know how to act
Lookin' all crazy, sipping on something that'll make you feel amazing
Came in my room and saw the posters from the 80's

You ignore me daily, threw me shade even after jamming tapes that I made yeah
Madonna, Nirvana, Cyndi Lauper singing out the blues
Wanna play fake doctor, come and let me play this game with you
Call me Messiah, come and kiss me from the top of the church
But you won't give me no chance, that's why I can't stand hoes

Bro said keep your pants on before you end up dancing
With a baby in a hospital and a mother-in-law and a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law and a father-in-law
God, I wouldn't mind that at all
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Daddy brought his gun out, but I'm still knocking
The sun was coming back around, but I'm still falling
Even though you do these things, girl, I know you want me
This little light of mine, watch you until I go blind

Why you cheatin'? Why you lyin'?
Girl, you must be out yo mind
Plotting, scheming on the low, lyin', thieving, you so cold
Dreaming until we grow old, I know you hear me, quit acting like you don't

Hey, hey, girl, let's go, tell me something that I'd like to know
Take me to a place that I'd like to go, we can stay here now, the weather ain't that cold
Sing to me but use your throat, do that thing I know you hate, but your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, you know I love

Is ya down to watch the sun rise? Is ya down to let me fuck ya right?
Is ya ever gonna call me back? Is ya daddy still mad at that?
I won't move my car out the drive, come and let me take you for a ride
Killed my best friend, me and my bae sitting sideways
They don't like me, I know you blocked my number, baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Daddy brought his gun out, but I'm still knocking
The sun was coming back around, but I'm still falling
Even though you do these things, girl, I know you want me
I know you blocked my number, baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Love the green, but the red look awesome
Love the sex, but the head was awesome
Smoke filled the room, we jammed Janis Joplin
Wanna hold until we go numb, wanna cum until it's no fun
Wanna get a gun just to own one

What if I took your heart and made a street?
What if you burned my soul instead of your weed?
Why must you do things that always make me weak?
Wipe the filth off of your palms inside your mother's sink

All the love that we kept, all the secrets, too
The closets open, still room for me and you
There's a war outside, no love inside
There's a guy in my mind with a nine that shine
I hope he blast it, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open",rap

The heat, and make the street jog like you on a treadmill
Sometimes I'm so high I feel like I'm from outer space
I'm on a mission and I got the movement to take its place
My rhymes like maps and my style ain't no surprise
I'm coming through so don't try to stand in my way and you'll be wise 
Listen to my homies on the corner and they'll tell you
That when I get a flow it's gonna be like a Big Bang Theory 
Like an explosion, I don't think it can wait
Now when I start to grip the mic I rip it like an 8
No matter where I'm at I spit a style so unique
Take the track and make it crack like a split pea soup
My rhymes is like a gun, and you better watch out
Cause I'm gonna blow up the spot and make it shout
No limits when it come to my lyrical flight
My flow's so tight it'll make your mind go blind tonight
And when I step up to the mic and drop it low
I'll make your hip hop soul jump up and shine like a light show

Democracy is the land of the free, but we all might die if there's a World War Three

Catch me up in the clubs, throwing money and sippin' champagne on ice
I'm so far ahead of time, I'm a king of this trap
Nothing left to understand, now I'm making a stack
This money's getting bigger, no time to play games
You can tell by the way my pockets are getting swollen
Couple bricks in the attic, it's a blessing and a curse
I been ballin' on my enemies, they know I'm the worst
Money, power and respect it's all that I seek
I'm in the club, stuntin' on these bitches, and sippin' on drank
Gotta keep it real like it's written in the street
These niggas know my name, I'm air force feet
My life is a movie, no one can script me
My life is real, so don't wanna get with me
Money talks, bitches listen, and haters watch
Tried to take me down, but I'm ready for the guap",rap

No time to dwell on the past
My life could never be like a book from the stack
My granny used to say I'm no ordinary guy
No love like ours can ever be denied

Holding on, to this moment in time
The sun on my face, it's feeling so refinement
Reaching out and taking control
My heart is strong, I'm never losing my soul

Try me, try me, come and see what I'm made of
Story of my life, it's never hard to love
From the struggle comes real stories of strength
This is life, and I'm owning it every step

The flow of the music is like a river that's wild
My words keep on creating a new rhyme
Hearts that we touch will always be on the rise
We show them love and we fill it with pride

Try me, try me, and you'll never be the same
No more running, your love will remain
Stay true to this bond, it's the only thing that matters
My heart and soul won't ever be shattered

Take me high, so I can touch the sky
My love for you, an intangible thing
Stay with me as I journey through life
We'll laugh and we'll cry, and feel nothing but delight

Try me, try me, never say goodbye
My love will stay, and I'll never deny
This bond that we have, it's something so strong
We'll never fade, and forever we'll see it along",rap

Hear me now and then spread around.

Gonna break the rules and step up our game-changers.

Verse 1
Tech Money tech money, tech money tech money
The same corporate giants rollin' round like it's funny
The way they move in just to take it away
Can't even afford to rent the same day it hits the way
The tide rolls in, sit and watch the show
The culture gone, the rent sky high like a rainbow
Where we gonna go, the gentrification's out of control
How can we make it out, there's no goin' back as we know

Chorus
Tech money tech money, tech money tech money
Been seein' it since the 90's with the dot com condo
Money's made and its never enough
It's squeezing us out and it's really too tough

Verse 2 
Eviction signs seen all around the block
Tired of fighting it, no more we can take, the shock
Empty lots and corporate logos, can't stand it no more
Gettin' pushed out, I'm ready to roar
Heading to the streets and standing for my rights
Losing the culture, this dead end life
Tired of the same cycle, livin' in despair
The people, the culture, the spirit, all gone from here

Don't let em take it, we gotta make this right
We have the power, we'll have the might
Corporate culture try to follow, but they won't win
Show em we got the strength to take it back again
We'll bring the culture back with no doubt
The same way we took it away, there's no way out
We'll be dashing on hope, empowerin' the people
Gettin' it back with all we can give to the sequel

Verse 1
I'm tryna get a grip on the situation,
Livin' large in the wrong destination
Ain't got the flow, got no destination
Just trying to find a livin' situation
The rents too high and the wages too low
Start to feel like I'm livin' in a snow globe
Tech money, tech money, tech money, tech money
Saw it comin' in, when I sensed danger
Money flows, but it still feels strange
'Cause the ones with the wealth, they don't look the same
Just roll with it, accept the change

Verse 2
Got the tech money, do the tech dance
Can't afford to take a chance
Rather take the risk, like showin' my hand
Gettin' the shots, but runnin' out of plans
The stakes are high and the game is cold
The tech geeks are having their way with the world
Tech money, tech money, tech money, tech money
They reorganize, to get the most money
Discriminating the low, so that's why I moan
Feels like a hurricane, but we won't be blown
Forcefully evicted, by the techs with no soul

Verse 3
My family's homeless, I'm just tryin' to cope
Where's the culture at? It's been robbed of its hope
It's like my city is too far in and I'm out
And they don't seem to care what it's all about
But I'm not gonna quit, I put down my sword
Gonna use my stormin' voice to break down the doors
Tech money, tech money, tech money, tech money
Gonna talk about the ways they get paid
It's gonna be part of the message I'm set to be made
Fight for my rights, gettin' ready to wage
The battle of my life, I'm gonna make it my stage",rap

Lost in the darkness, nocturnal rhymes I spit
Feeling wicked, sick and twisted, need a hit
The Devil's eyes, they follow me and they never quit
I disappear, I'm taking flights of fear just a bit
The punk rock steel toes and horns and halos, I'm blessed
Nine inch nails rattle, now no one can forget
Ricochet off the walls, and then flow down the hall
Gotta get paid, Mr. Shifty Switchblade can't fall

Wrapped in the moonlight I'm ready to ride
A feeling I can't seem to define
The power it holds keeps me mesmerized
That charm and those dreams keep me hypnotized

Or fly to the heavens that watch over you, telling me it's all voodoo
Voodoo too, it's just what you do

As I start to move, I feel the night take me
An emotion so powerful I can't deny
A blissful euphoria I can never describe
A destination that I never want to arrive

Unlocking a realm of passion unbound
Power of the unknown, I lose all control
Unleashing a love like never before

Verse1:
Feel the power of the unknown,
Mysteries of the soul are shown,
Carry me to higher heights,
Exploring all the hidden sights,
And as I journey through the stars,

A vision appears in a spectral form,
Awakened by a holy storm.

My body reacts in an altered state,
A spiritual force that's inside me,
Helping me to open up and see,
Arriving in my sacred space,

All the secrets I'll soon possess.

It's the knowledge of the unseen,
That sets me free from all my sins,

The power of the voodoo too feeds my soul,
And guides me on my journey home.

'Cause when the mobb turn it up, we just blast away
When that heat come around, niggas run and hit the pavement.
Been runnin' through the hoods, makin' moves for days
Jumpin' out the car in the groove, blastin' all these ways.

Gettin' money every night, that's why these hoes roll.
Fishtailin' on the highway, I got my hands on the wheel
Pushin' that gas, tryin' to make a real-life deal.
Runnin' through the hoods, lookin' for a spot to hit
With the AK on my side, they know I'm slippin' with the grit.
Shootin up the clubs, breakin' up a fight
Gettin' all the money and leavin' without a sight.

In the game forever, ridin' through the streets, this is my claim.

Bust out my AK, y'all gotta show respect or I'm shootin'
From the hood to the club bumpin' this heat
Where I come from they don't mess around on the street

Verse 1:

Let me take it straight to the top, I ain't stoppin'
My Glock's hot with a full clip, no breakin'
My AK is puttin' in much work, poppin' the clip
A little voice in my head said, ""Let's make 'em trip""

Chorus:

Gonna hit the club and get drunk, but they better start gettin' off

All up in the drop with the riot pump, blazin'

Verse 3:

Punks want funk, but they don't shoot once, hit the gas
And then they gone, little ho tried to pick Bo like an afro

But I was blinded, by my own delusions too
Though I've done all I can, I'm failing really badly
Couldn't wake your Sleeping Beauty or help you face her sadly

Chorus:
Sleeping Beauty, so poisoned and helpless
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
My efforts were for naught, so desperately I seek
To find a way to bring you back, a cure so incredibly bleak

Verse 2:
Breaking through the haze, I thought I could break these chains
Hiding from a poison, you can't ever truly explain
Maybe I was wrong, my efforts barely show
My futile attempts, only making your pain grow

Chorus:
Sleeping Beauty, so poisoned and helpless
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
My efforts were for naught, so desperately I seek
To find a way to bring you back, a cure so incredibly bleak

Verse 3:
My ego was so high, thought I could make it right
If I kissed you one more time, to bring you light
But you were too far gone, for me to heal
My deluded mind, I had to soon reveal

Verse 1 
I've looked and seen what's ahead of me, 
My heart is broken, I can't take no more, 
These lonely nights, my faith is low, 
Where can I find the hope I once knew? 
I watched the seasons come and go, 
My face still holds a feel of woe, 
First step I take, I'm sure of this, 
I'm in trouble, this much I miss.

Chorus 
Tell me how can I live without somebody like you? 
Somebody like you, tell me how can I live without somebody like you?
Please tell me it's almost over.

Verse 2 
I'm here feeling lost and alone,
The room is filled with reminders of you,
Memories rushing through my mind,
My heart can't take this pain of mine.

Chorus 
Tell me how can I live without somebody like you? 
Somebody like you, tell me how can I live without somebody like you?
Please tell me it's almost over.

How can I live without you? 
As I watch the stars at night, 
How can I live without you? 
My heart still beats, but I'm still alone tonight.

Somebody like you, tell me how can I live without somebody like you?

And sit around like a parrot, all brainwashed and told

My mission is clear, just tryna break the chains
The lies and all the pains, I'm tryna make a change
The pollution of the world, my mind made a choice

I know this young nigga who loves to keep his gun in his pockets
Gotta get this cash quick, tryin to dodge all these block rocks  
He lost his Moms at a young age, Pops was crackin'
Family house was full of drugs, they slept with their macs out
Where we stay, no basketball teams, no neighbors, it's all 'bout makin' the cream
So he stayed dirty, copped a clip for thirty, chose sellin' drugs than bein' nerdy
Had his hardhat but still ready for war, got his heart gone, I saw this before
He lived day by day, prey by prey, stayed blunted on Chancellor Ave
380 hallway, bought an AK, I know he gonna spray
It ain't no damn way that he can turn his life around, man  
Gotta stay eatin', so he got the clip out, all smoked up, put his finger on the trigger, death flew out
Hit a man, layin' on the pavement, all stiff, blood dripping from his face, damn
Now what a surprise that Little Ant can't come around
It's his own man dead on the ground, dead on the ground  
Lost, turned out, no doubt, what's it all 'bout?
Lost, turned out, no doubt, what's it all 'bout?  
Baby girl, I can see you in that crazy world, spinnin' out of control, nowhere to go
At one point in time, you could've been mine, but movin' too fast, couldn't take the chance 
High school homies, now they became friends before lovers, kinda like sister and brother
My momma workin' all the time, your daddy snoopin', drinkin' and creepin'
What he thinking, tryin' to bump and grind?
We escaped to each other, I had my dreams, my plane leavin' soon, but had to hook up with Pac 
Called twice, but you weren't home, somethin' was wrong, I was right  
Found you one night, barely holdin' on, where did you go wrong?
Was it when you started strippin' for tips, then sellin' it for more chips?
Sniffin' powder, just to deal with it, now you gone, before it can be fixed
My brother, Sean, he's home now, I love him to death, but stayin' in all the bullshit  
Gettin' older, middle school around the corner, drug dealers teachin' what they wanna
I made my first sale in a alleyway, I was scared as shit, but not of the cops
More scared of what Moms Duke'll do, chilled for a few, rather than spend weekends with the homies
Food was low, but Moms made it good, and I was countin' every single cent they made
Moms got hurt, slipped on the ice, caught a back spasm, tried to deal with the pain
Lost and turned out, but still comin' home to you, I love you, I love you
Lost and turned out, but still comin' home to you, I love you

I can see this young nigga with a gun in his jeans
Workin hard in the streets for a little green
He was tryin to make a lot of money fast

But there's no way for him to turn his life around
Cuz livin on the streets he'll eventually be found
He try to put a lid on his fears and his doubts
But it's hard to escape when you livin with no out 
Damn, He's lost and turned out, not a doubt what's it all about
Livin a life filled with pain and with doubt
But he's still comin home to his loved ones at night
Tryna keep it together and make it alright
So he hustles all day just to be able to survive
But he's hopin one day he escape this way of life
Makin sure that he can take care of his family
Stayin by their side no matter what's to be
Lost and turned out still comin home to you, I love you
Lost and turned out still comin home to you, I love you
He's lost and turned out not a doubt what's it all about
Lost and turned out not a doubt what's it all about
In a world where he's lost and his future is seen as out of bounds 
He still doin his best to make the right sound
Tryna keep it positive and stay on the right track 
But his way of life will always come with a lack
No matter how hard he try to free himself
Old habits die hard and he's livin by himself
He's tryin to make a real life not just one of vice
So he keep tryin and hold on to the advice

Man, I thought I was dreaming
Manipulating me like I'm nothing but a puppet on a string

Verse 1:
It's like a constant struggle to break free from you,
I'm trying to find a way to start anew.
But it's not easy, you know, with the weight of what you say,
I'm stuck in a place where nothing never changes.
You try to control me with your words,
But that only molds me into a bird,
That's trying to break free from its cage,
Cause I'm tired of living in a wrong age.

I'm trying to remain strong but it's not easy,
So many questions, so little answers I seek.
I'm trying hard, to get away from the lies,
But all I'm feeling, is more pain in disguise.
It's like I'm being dragged down in a whirlpool,
The only thing that I can do is keep it cool.
And try to keep my head above the water,
Just to stay alive, so I can still keep my honor.

VERSE 1
I woke up with thoughts of ambition
Rapping hard and grinding on the rhythm
No matter where I go I'm heard with precision
Pushing through the limits of my mission
Money's my obsession but I don't play those games

Haters gonna hate, but when I win, it's still the same
I'm destined for greatness, so I won't take their aim

CHORUS
Cause I'm a risk, but if you put it on I'mma win
If you give it time, I won't forget when I'm a legend baby and we're all rich

I got you, I promise, I promise I'm on it

VERSE 2
My sight is set to greater heights, no holding me back
Dreams of a better life, I'm ready for this track
They tried to break me down, but I went the other way
Hustling hard and grinding until I get paid

Ain't no stopping me, no matter what comes
Through the pain and the struggle I remain strong
Ready to take these steps and nothing's gonna go wrong

Gotta take on all my fears and keep pushin' on

Verse 2:
Got a plan and a vision, I'm pushin' every day

Stayin' on the grind, see the light through the dyin'
Gonna take it all the way, gonna make it to the top
Gonna take it all on, so it never ever stops

Verse One:
I'm just sittin' here watchin' you, livin' like a fool
It's like this man don't have a clue, don't have a thing to do
You don't realize what you got, you should be feelin' blessed
But instead I'm sittin' here seein' you in a total mess
He don't appreciate you, it's plain to see
It's breaking my heart, but I'm gonna let it be

Verse Two:
I can't stand to see you so low, like you don't have no soul
You got the beauty and the grace, a heart of gold
You deserve to have the world, cause you deserve the best
But your man don't understand, and he don't give you no rest
He ain't gonna take you for granted, no more that's for sure
I just gotta stand back and trust, cuz I know the time will cure

Verse Three:
So why don't you take a stand, show the world what you got
Ain't gonna be no man, that can make you feel like you're not
You got the power and the strength, to reach heights you never dreamed
It's gonna take some time, but I know it won't be as it seems
You're gonna get it together, you know what you gotta do
And then you'll see there's no man, that can ever compare to you

Chorus:

He ain't the one, he don't deserve

So many times you shed those tears

If he don't appreciate how you feel
My love for you will never fail

Bein' real with yourself and me
Cause you know that's the only way to be

I've been so faithful to God, though I tried to turn away
But I'm still struggling just to keep up, and I can't seem to find the way 
Even when I'm on top, I still feel like I'm below
There's never enough money to make up for the love I don't know
I used to be so proud, and people said I'm the man 
I thought I could take on the world, but it all just fell apart like sand
I've been so ungrateful, God I'm sorry for the times I said goodbye
I'll never be able to take away the hurt I caused to you, so I try
I'm hoping that someday, the truth will set me free 
I'm hoping that the truth will show me the real me

Verse 1
Lookin' out across the street, see the chosen one
Tryin' to make her way, pushin' through the dust and sun
Ain't had no second chance, no one to pick her up
She lookin' for her strength, they told her it's enough

Beautiful is how we know you though
Rebel rebel for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle reach out
And rip the back of your head off, leavin' your skull peaceful

So misunderstood, a burden on her brow
So misunderstood, but she still holdin' on somehow
Her broken wings still can carry her along
She never let the past define who she become

Beautiful is how we know you, though rebel rebel for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle reach out and rip the back of your head off

Verse 2:
Where mommas and poppas didn't teach what's right
You do what's yours, ain't no one there to protect you in the night
But you still got up and gave life a try
Fighting against all odds, no grave will be your home, no lie

Beautiful is how we know you, though we were all taught to root for the underdogs
One nation under God complex, no wonder we all wanna watch 'em undercover cops
Beautiful is how we know you though

Verse 3:
They said you have no chance of ever making it
But you still rise up, never letting it break you bit by bit
You chose to fight, knowing it would be tough
Courage within so strong, you'll never give in to their bluff

Beautiful is how we know you, though so beautiful so upset
Came from a place that bred success, so shame on the grass on that side of the fence
Beautiful is how we know you though

Misunderstood but you keep going strong
You built yourself up piece by piece and worked your way to the top where you belong
Painful memories, but still you keep it real
No matter what comes, you know you can truly make a deal

To lead the change and get these people up on their feet

My lyrics will raise your vibrations to places unseen
To open your mind and let the world know what it means

I bring an original style, a form of creativity that no one can deny
From the concrete jungles to indigenous lands
My words can be heard by the masses and I'm ready to stand

"ing that s what i m about green cup full of lean thunder in the sky i m hearing the sounds pouring up brown and yellow my swag dripping while i m on the low h dollars in the banks and my feet steady spitting out the flow got my eyes on the door my cup full of syrup and more hooked up with the team and the syrup at the store 

Racks in my pocket, got some cash to blow
My top down in my hood, thats the way to go
Pouring up some lean, got my eyes all red
Gotta get my fix, can't go to bed
I'm so high, it's like I'm in the sky
Everything I see, so damn fly
So much fire, it can't be denied
Sippin on my cup, 'til I'm satisfied
I mix that Qualitest with the clean
Dreaming of a lake, filled full of lean
Rainbow colors in my cup, what a sight to see
Jolly Ranchers mane, this shits good as f***
Got residue on my shirt, my cup's gettin' dirty
Moving slow, on the e-way, doing 'bout thirty
Been drinking and driving, won't have it no more
Gettin' throwed, swervin' all over the floor
Brick Squad, the ones I'm talkin' 'bout
Green cup filled with lean, thunder in the cloud
It's pouring up brown and yellow, my swag is drippin'
Yellow dolla's in the banks and my feet keep spittin'
Got my eyes on the door, my cup full of syrup and more
Hooked up with the team, the syrup at the store
I'm so high, I can't even hit the floor
Movin' like a king, my cup full of syrup and fo'",rap
" i walk in the club got the double cup 

Hold up, I'ma get me a double cup
Reach for the syrup, cause I'm makin' it tough
Roll it up, I'ma smoke it up, ain't no stoppin' me now
Mix it with the tea and take me to the stars
Riding round free, sippin' this lean
Hear me run up on the scene, rubber bands and some cream
I'm sippin' that purple-yellow, getting low like a bell
Feeling like I'm in the clouds, I just want to feel the breeze
Swear I'm feeling like a king, can't nobody tell me nothing
Pass me the lean and roll me a sweet
Can't nobody take away my heat
Got me feeling like the streets runnin' through my veins
Takin' me higher than the satellite
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
Got me poppin' bottles in VIP, head foggy like the sea
Rappers talkin' money, but never really got it
Switchin' up the cup, can't keep it static
Ain't no stoppin' me, cause I'm ridin' with the top
Smokin' and leanin', I'm feeling like a rockstar
I'm too high to be stopped, it's a vibe I can't drop
My double cup is heavy, with syrup and weak
My nigga, pour me some more, cause I'm feeling like I'm free
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
Feel this heat I breath, hot like the summer
I'm here to stay, no need to run and hide
Livin' my life on the block and I ain't tryina switch it
Can't get enough of this syrup so I keep sippin' it
This my story, my life, this is my mission
Drinkin' on syrup, cause that's the only thing keepin' me alive
Throwing up sign and I'm living for the night
This my life, tippin' my cup, only thing I'm doin' is gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed",rap

Commitment to the music, no time for fairy tales

Cuz with my flow they can't stop me, not even clowns

Don't need the rules, I'll take my own load

Verse 1
I'm a G in this flow, hit the mic and let it go
Tell the truth, staying true to the game, don't need no show
Cause it's all business, I'm a hustler, I'mma stay grittin'
You can't knock it, man, tell 'em how I'm livin'
My pen's on fire, can't put out this flame
Gotta stay consistent, shout out my name
Be the Don I'm destined, and I'm all about the dough
Can't help if the money keeps comin' in, I'm just ready to flow

Verse 2
I'm the one, so yeah it's time to take a leap
Gotta keep moving, keep banging out the beats
Money's my motivation and it's time to stay paid
Ain't too much time for chit chat or debate
Ok, let me run it back, yeah, I'm bringing it back
Been a long time, gonna take a lot of rap
Growing up, seen a lot of things, yeah, I know the facts
Gone now but never forget, can't go back

Verse 3
My engine's on, I'ma keep it rolling through the city
Ain't nothing but a party, so get ready for the pity
My flow is like a weapon, might need a permit
Tell the truth and keep it real, no need to fake it

Staying focused, still the same, can't change
This is what I'm born for, just another day in the game",rap

Verse 1 
Hear my words, they bring the light,
Bringin' faith to hopeless flight,
Gettin' tired of the same ol' plight,
It's the same old stories, the same ol' fight.

I'm from the hood and the struggle's real,
Gotta stay focused if you want to appeal,
Nobody's gonna hand you a deal,
You gotta figure it out with no retreat.

Chorus
It's up and downs for a real nigga,
You'll be lame all your life hater,
But don't pull the trigger,
You got something to contribute, regardless what you into.

Verse 2 
The odds against us, but we can't give in,
The people around us don't show no wins,
Remember that it's full of sin,
And one wrong step can spin us around again.

Gotta stay strong and keep the faith,
Don't let the game determine our fate,
Stay away from the mac 10 in the black Benz,
Those signals of betrayal will make you descend.

Chorus
It's up and downs for a real nigga,
You'll be lame all your life hater,
But don't pull the trigger,
You got something to contribute, regardless what you into.

Verse 3
From the triple bunks to the street talks,
Life's a maze, sometimes you gotta walk,
Bet my life I'm a dice shaker,
Electric lights on a skyscraper.

We've all been raised wrong but we stayed strong,
We gotta get the most from life before the song's done,
Gotta make sure we're helping each other out,
Victory will come when we shout.

Chorus
It's up and downs for a real nigga,
You'll be lame all your life hater,
But don't pull the trigger,
You got something to contribute, regardless what you into.",rap
" and above 

Yeah uh yeah this your life you can play with it 
Do your thing just be safe with it 
I'm still up in this game, nothing to lose and no gain 
My attitude's got me livin' with no shame 
I'm tired of hustling, tired of grindin' 
Cause all I got is my hustle and my pride
I need to keep it moving, can't fall behind
Gotta keep my focus and my faith alive

My only weapon is the wisdom I find 
In the street I'm searching for something I can own
If I'm fallin' down, I'm on the rise
I'm stayin' strong, I'm livin' for the prize

The vision I have I keep alive
Ain't nobody stoppin' me to take the drive
The odds might be against me but I'ma thrive
My life's what I make of it, I'ma survive 

I'm steppin' out, gonna get it right
I'ma breach the darkness, I'ma be the light
I'm learnin' somethin' new every night
Strengthenin' my spirit and standing up to the fight

My goals and my dreams, I'm gonna reach 'em high
I'm followin' the path of destiny I'm tryin' 
To stay alive and keep it real 
And never let no one stop me from achieving my goals",rap

Chorus:
I got the devil in me and it's a cloud,
I try to find a way to stay on top of the cloud.
Fuel and release, happiness is good for an hour,
These thoughts I have they seem to pass me by like a cloud.

Verse 1:
When I look to find compassion, it vanishes like a ghost,
I need some laughter, so I can feel less like a ghost.
I was praying for some relief, but it just seemed so distant,
I hate what he did to her, I can’t stand for his persistence.

Chorus:

Verse 2:
My burdens are heavy, and I’m barely staying afloat,
The darkness seems to follow, I can’t even keep afloat.
I find myself drowning more and more every single day,
I know there has to be a way out of this wretched place.

Chorus:

Verse 3:
I must find the courage to overcome this internal ghost,
I can't keep living in sadness, I can't keep living like a ghost.
I've gotta find a way to rise above the dark and sahaed sky,
So I can escape this storm, these dark thoughts won't take me by.

My heart can't stop beating so fast, prayers for joy but no one cares
The sadness that brings me to tears, in this world of fear I'm caught
And day after day, I just go on, no release from this mental war I fought

And I'm gonna make it, I'm never gonna break it
In the back of my mind I know I can take it
So when I come around its like yeah yeah yeah
They got a bad chick named Roxanne
She don't pop xan no mo, she don't pop xan no mo
Feelin' like a million bucks so I'm gonna break it down
Don't worry 'bout what these haters say just keep living life to the sound
Lost in the music and the lights, yeah that's where I'm at
Get lost in the beat and I'm never ever comin' back
Ayy, I'ma show em somethin' new so they can't ignore me
Gonna make em get to krunk when they come up in the party
Yeah yeah yeah, they got a bad chick named Roxanne
She don't pop xan no mo, she don't pop xan no mo
I'm gonna be the one they can't forget
I'm gonna go round the world and show em it was worth it
Yeah, I'm gonna keep on grindin' and I'm never gonna quit
Gonna take what I deserve 'til I'm sittin' at the top of the list
Yeah yeah yeah, they got a bad chick named Roxanne

Verse 1
I'm livin life around the clock
Tryin to make sense of what I see, life's a puzzle I can't unlock
My heart is heavy, searching for a remedy
But all I see is lies and false reality
In the hood it's criminal activity
My momma said, ""Always do right and stay away from the streets""
But I'm surrounded by folks livin' life on the beat
Now I'm running out of hope, they just don't understand
I'm tryin' to make it but I don't have a plan
The pressure's building, the stress I can't hide
I'm tryin' to live and not get caught on the ride

Chorus
The world is a crazy place, a smiling face may or may not be friendly
Good things have side effects, bad things have benefits
I wanna live till the end, try to survive all the messed up tunes and verses
Curses and drivebys, unheard of opinions, and bad beef and greasy fries
Teachers who are unwise, preachers between young thighs
Guns, knives and power in the wrong hands, landlords and crooked cops, oh Lord
Look at the shit we stand for, plan for a perfect life and ended up gettin jerked

Verse 2
I bid a farewell to the life I thought I knew
I'm running away to a place where I can find my true self
Away from materialistic things, and social status
Away from the fools who only want us to fail
Away from the darkness, to a light that will lead me
To a world where I can fight for a better tomorrow
My dreams give me hope, as I try to stay focused
I'm gonna keep on grinding, until I find a way out
I'm gonna break free from the chains and the misery
The world is not gonna hold me back from what I can be

Chorus
The world is a crazy place, a smiling face may or may not be friendly
Good things have side effects, bad things have benefits
I wanna live till the end, try to survive all the messed up tunes and verses
Curses and drivebys, unheard of opinions, and bad beef and greasy fries
Teachers who are unwise, preachers between young thighs
Guns, knives and power in the wrong hands, landlords and crooked cops, oh Lord
Look at the shit we stand for, plan for a perfect life and ended up gettin jerked",rap
"

I atak like PM on the meanest tracks,
I make the people move, I show them where I'm at.
Came from the hood tryna get a perfect life,
End up getting jipped, don't understand the strife.

Chorus
This universe universe fucked up tunes and verses,
Curses and drivebys, unheard opinions and bad beef.
Greasy fries and teachers who are unwise,
Preachers between young thighs and guns, knives and power in the wrong hands.

Paying my dues and a little bit of extra,
Only fresh effects I saw came from Corey Shaw.
Can't get too wild and too raw, can't help but be scared and unprepared
Know in life you motherfuckers just don't care.

So I struggle on and try to get my bubble on,
Stumble upon a little light, I'm trying to magnify.
Be damned if I don't fit into the plan,
Been around the block, life has me in a trance.

Good things have side effects, bad things have benefits,
Try and live until the end and watch Armageddon's set.
TV's got some hella good shows and the internet,
That shit's off the hook and illuminates the effects.

I drop a book in a second, being stuck with technology advancement,
The world is a crazy place and a smiling face may or may not be friendly.
One way or another, life is unpredictable,
My little brother's rich and Wolfhawk Tommy's a father.

Chorus
This universe universe fucked up tunes and verses,
Curses and drivebys, unheard opinions and bad beef.

Verse 1: 
As luck would have it, My best friend, the brown skin nigga with the braids, not the pussy nigga with the fade
Had to focus on our career, others tryna be club owners
Got the ears of a major label now, everybody in the world on it
Heart of a Tiger will commit homicide, dismantle any challengers or rivals
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive, NTM-A to police, you'll never take me alive

Chorus:
I'm a Tiger, I'm a Tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
Until you make the peace, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger

Verse 2: 
Altercations, I'm thinking Travis must really hate me
Been like a brother since middle school, woulda never rapped until he made me
Used to flip hoes together, go out together, do shows together still amazes me
Kinda crazy how popularity can make you change
Got his nova, I was happy for him
Got his Burban, I was happy for him
Got his Benz, I was happy for him
Got his Hummer, I was happy for him
No nigga round I wouldn'ta splattered for him, put their head on a platter for him
Never disrespected your bitch boy I protected your bitch boy
When niggas that we both know was tryna put dick on your bitch boy
All you ever did was criticize me, pillow talk to the world bout me
These tears drops on my face real, My mom will tell you I'm not stuntin
Juvenile detention for self defense, broad day I popped somethin

Chorus:
I'm a Tiger, I'm a Tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
Until you make the peace, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger

Verse 3:
Her ex boyfriend broke her ribs, blacked her eyes I shot somethin 
Scuse me, I'm my own man in jail or on land always tryna fight me
How the fuck you hurt a nigga you love, I would never put my hands on you
Reason being you a nigga I love, Heart of a Tiger will commit homicide
Dismantle any challengers or rivals, Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
NTM-A to police, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger

Outro:
I'm a Tiger, I'm a Tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive

The sound of the street is calling my name
My soul is aching, my heart is full of pain
Stuck in a cycle of poverty and strife
I'm down but I'm not out, I'm ready for a new life

The pain I embrace, it won't keep me down
Cuz I'm a black man and I won't back down
I won't be afraid, I'll keep on pushing on
To find a new way even when the odds are long

Chorus:
I'm livin trife, I'm livin life on the darkside
Fed up, I'm done with stressin, I'm breakin the ties
Givin up the pain and losin my pride
Move forward, I'm gonna reach the other side

See myself through different eyes
Release the hate and anger inside
As I search for redemption, I won't forget
My brothers and my sisters, they'll never forget

A new way of thinkin, the devil can't take
A truer perspective, it's never too late
Look out for those around, I'll be their guide
Cos I can't give up, I'm never denied

Chorus:
I'm livin trife, I'm livin life on the darkside
Fed up, I'm done with stressin, I'm breakin the ties
Givin up the pain and losin my pride
Move forward, I'm gonna reach the other side

Livin on the darkside, life ain't easy
My soul is searchin, I'm lookin for an escape
I'm never gonna give up, I'm gonna stand tall
My head heldhigh and my future is on the wall

No more pain or sorrow, this I can see
A new life awaits me, a brighter destiny
I'm livin trife, I'm livin life on the darkside
And nothing can stop me, I'm reachin the other side

Chorus:

They can't take away my vision, I done made it clear,
An OG in the game, playin' with no fear,
My hustle's on blast and I'm never losin' steam,
Livin' life a king, I'm the one they call to be,
How it feel to be a real nigga,
How it feel to be a real nigga,
How it feel to be a real nigga,
How it feel to be a real nigga.",rap

Verse 1:
Y'all can talk but I'ma keep dropping these bars
Know these beats I'm spitting hit harder than cars
Rolling with my squad, we ain't no throwers
Run up on us and we'll leave you in zero
Set this track off with a crack like a gun
Going out of bounds, but I'm still getting it done
Flow smooth like honey, I ain't from the hood
Gonna go hard and y'all know you ain't gon' stop me for good

Chorus:
I just want to jam for you
Rhymes that hit hard like rumble in a zoo
I'm gonna keep it going long

Dipping and dodging, they know G ain't no joke
I just want to jam for you

Verse 2:
Keeping it real, I don't play like a clown
Beating these tracks, I'ma put it down
Gonna break it down like lego blocks
Duplicating style, but my flows unique like knock

Until you feel this power and you know it's sound
Rock it on the mic and make your heart pound
Gonna show the world what I got, ain't no holding back now

I just want to jam for you
Rhymes that hit hard like rumble in a zoo

Dipping and dodging, they know G ain't no joke
I just want to jam for you

Verse 3:
My beats go hard and I'ma keep it up
You already know G is gonna light it up
Getting down like a double-dutch rope
I'ma keep 'em coming, no way to cope
And I'ma keep it hype, with flows that's real tight
Yeah, these beats are nice, but these rhymes are out of sight
You can tell G is never gonna lose the fight
From the start to the finish, gonna bring the light

Chorus:
I just want to jam for you
Rhymes that hit hard like rumble in a zoo
I'm gonna keep it going long
Knocking these tracks out like 'em for sure
I just want to jam for you
Making sure I keep it true

Dipping and dodging, they know G ain't no joke

Verse 1:
Gripping to memories of you, my past is all I have
Your silhouette in the wind I see, a part of me that I can’t let go
It’s okay to get scared and feel the pain, there’s no need to be ashamed
Just rise up and make the change, let me be the one to take the blame

Chorus:
I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling likely dreaming of the pain
I hope you’ll hear me in the streetlights, humming softly breathing out your name
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling scars will remain
So let’s scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain

Verse 2:
The dark skies won’t let us reach the sun, but I can still feel the warmth of your touch
Your love keeps my heart alive and I hope it never does enough
Cause I still see us underway, even though you’re miles away
A bond that’ll never break, no matter how far we sway

Chorus:
I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling likely dreaming of the pain
I hope you’ll hear me in the streetlights, humming softly breathing out your name
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling scars will remain
So let’s scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain

Bridge:
And when they run into the river oh no let the water not complain
I swear that even with the distance slowly wearing out your name
Your hands still catch the light the right way, and our hearts still beat the same

Chorus:
I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling likely dreaming of the pain

Likely dreaming off the pain
I hope you'll hear me in the streetlights humming,

Verse 2:
We made our choices, we had our voices,
Both too loud or too quiet.
But in the silence, I hear the violence,
The sound of our love being torn apart.

I know that even with the seams stitched tightly darling,
Scars will remain.
I say we scrape them from each other darling
And let them wash off in the rain.

And the thunder sing us by,
Reminding us just what we need,
Just what we need.

My rap bars of fire, my words like an iron spear
Contender beware when I drop the verbal atmosphere

Bring it hard and fast like a thunder in the night

Slangin' bars like an addict and never missin'
Tired of fake MCs that think they got game
Cause they ain't got nothing to show foor their name

Verse 1
All these years I have been nothing but lonely,
Seems like I’ve been here for far too long,
My fears and my feeling are deeply entrenched,
Stuck in this cycle of being forever gone.

Chorus
Say you want to leave and say we'd never have the way,
We always hope and we'd cry and say hello to alone again,
Coz everything's broken, everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again,
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded, everything's wasted time again.

Verse 2
Struggles and heartache have only gotten worse,
My life a never-ending spiral of pain,
Unable to touch the joys I never had,
Caught in a state of permanent disdain.

Chorus
Say you want to leave and say we'd never have the way,

Never could find the peace I was so longing for,
And so we leave this stage with all our best written lines,
Heads held high as we march toward the door.

Chorus
Say you want to leave and say we'd never have the way,
We always hope and we'd cry and say hello to alone again,
Coz everything's broken, everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again,
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded, everything's wasted time again.",rap
" and move on with our lives

Verse 1:
Ain't no escaping all these feelings, it's so hard to keep believing
That we'll ever find a way back to our happy ending
These empty words between us can't cut the aching
So say it to my face, look me in the eye and just keep speaking

Chorus:
Say goodbye to alone again, 'cause everything's broken
Everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded
Everything's wasted time again

Verse 2:
We gotta keep our heads up, we gotta stay strong
Struggle for our freedom, even when it feels so wrong
The pressure tryna put us in a hopeless frame of mind
So we gotta rise up and we gotta be more kind

Chorus:
Say goodbye to alone again, 'cause everything's broken
Everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded
Everything's wasted time again

Verse 3:
No matter how far we go, these wounds will still remain
And all our sorrows will become the price to pay
But we must never forget what brought us to this day
So we'll just keep on pushing 'til we've finally found our way

Chorus:
Say goodbye to alone again, 'cause everything's broken
Everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded
Everything's wasted time again",rap

Verse 1:
Relationships can be tricky when you think you're in love
Everything's great, until you think that it's enough
The dude gets too familiar, and not in a good way
Time to put him in check and get him straight today

Chorus:
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
To me, To me, To me, oh (x4)

Verse 2:
No need for all the nonsense, keep it real and stay true
Don't try to tell me what I can, and what I can't do
Respect is key in any situation, fool
Be wise, don't be a head ass, and don't be a fool

Chorus:
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
To me, To me, To me, oh (x4)

Verse 3:
No need to complicate, got to keep our heads high
Play the game right, don't mess up and make a mistake
It's all about attitude, you know what I'm sayin'
If you play it right, you won't need to be playin'

Chorus:
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
To me, To me, To me, oh (x4)",rap

Verse 1:
That's what I heard, relationships can be so strange,
Seems like it's always a game of roulette and chance,
It's so hard with these feelings, cuz everything feels new,
So when emotions start to fade, you don't know what to do,

Chorus:
Don't be a headass, don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass,
Don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass, to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me.

Verse 2:
The temptation of being on your own can be so strong,
The idea of freedom can make you think you're right for so long,
But when things start to get real, and you don't wanna face,
That's when the doubt starts to come, and the truth is hard to chase.

Chorus:
Don't be a headass, don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass,
Don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass, to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me.

Verse 3:
No matter what your situation may be,
It's important to never forget how to stay true to you and me,
So before things start to get too deep,
Remember to never forget and stay true to yourself, me and the street.

Chorus:
Don't be a headass, don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass,
Don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass, to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me.",rap

We’ve come here from the ethers deep
Our journey never ended, it just gets further and deeper

But no force could make us stop or keep us grounded

This may be the last thing that I see so I take a look around,
I take a mental pic of the ground never forget what I found,
I can feel the clock running down, I heard that the more you wait,
The more you waste your life away and it's starting to become our fate,
My heart's aching and a little late, I know that something gotta give,
But I'm stuck between the right and wrong, I can't choose which one I live,
And when I think of the future I'm in a state of disbelief,
Only way to make it right is to take a leap of faith and believe.

So I breathe it in, I'm breathing it in,
Letting go of the pain and all that I been through,
Letting go of the past and the things I shouldn't do,
Holding on to the present, making sure the future is new,
And I'm ready to fight for a brighter tomorrow,
Been running away for so long and it's time to just stay and be strong,
There's too much happening, I can't stay calm,
Gonna stand my ground and make sure all of my goals are met way beyond.

This may be the last time I get to shine,
I'm gonna use every minute to make sure I'm align,
It's time to make changes in life and to take control,
And do my part in this world, put one foot in front of the other to reach my goals,
I heard that life ain't easy but I'm gonna stay true,
To the things that I believe, no matter what others tell me to do,
This may be the last chance I have to make things right,
Gonna keep pushing forward and make sure I get to the light.

See I'm getting lost, lost in the moment,
Gonna dance away the pain and cry whenever I want,
Find a way to express what I feel and I'm gonna keep going,
Until I reach the highest peak, even when my soul's low and my heart was broken,
Happy to be alive and doin' me,
Gonna keep moving forward and show my strength,
All those years of struggling wasn't in vain,
Gonna pick up the pieces to find my way again.

So I breathe it in, I'm breathing it in,
Letting go of the pain and all that I been through,
Letting go of the past and the things I shouldn't do,
Holding on to the present, making sure the future is new,
And I'm ready to fight for a brighter tomorrow,
Been running away for so long and it's time to just stay and be strong,
There's too much happening, I can't stay calm,
Gonna stand my ground and make sure all of my goals are met way beyond.",rap

Just give me a windbreaker, an I'm off in the night
Rap burglar murdered the first herb, who's claiming they never heard the rhyme
Giant defiant, I do it my way
Hydro-planning on tha highway, leanin' sideways, crime pays
These rhymes slay, leave 'em in the dust like the angel of music
In George we trust, rhyme pattern ridiculous
Tha conspicuous, locced out, smoked out
They rushin' the stage, tryna get choked out

Hook
Hotter than Death Valley in the summer
Ya bitch make a wish, blow it out, I'm tha re-up in a drought
Mix the stout with a lager, powered up like a lozenge
See me on tha news when I silence your favorite blogger, blam!

Verse 2
One shot, knock knock 'im out tha box
An' I'm off to th' land at the strand
Study tha flow of free speech like Francis Bacon
You're tuned in to genuine history in the makin'
When will tha P stop? Nobody knows
I construct prose with tha tenet that my tenure bestows
Close captions, you see what I'm rappin' right on tha screen
Like a limousine commercial, my rap city between tha blue an' red
It's life in my routine city, but being dead is just tha next step
An' so life's great, several prenatal success is not final
Failure is fatal, so I wake up everyday with tha pen an' play
Like potato, an' comin' straight out tha underground
I parlavor with all my fans and find a common ground that's real

Hook
We press it on vinyl, it can't be killed
If you throw it away, eternity rockin' tha land
Feel it 'til I'm refound or reground
You never know, we're infinitely larger than a DatPiff download
Just 1, 0, 1, 0, binary
Fairies are very different from the heroes from rap's yesteryear
The present, but I'm still here
He's still here, we still drink beer and take it to tha stage
At least half of tha year

Outro
So when you double an' thes on southwest
Gettin' drunk with no baggage in tha overhead
Just throw up tha funk 'cause it's not dead
In fact, it's very alive now, tha OGs with OG Kush
Blow out your SoundCloud on tha strand, watchin' it all go by
With my hand on tha wheel and a crazy dream of bein' king of a rap empire",rap
" so even though i m not where wanna be thank you lord cause i m not where my haters want me to be

I'm tryin' to reach the top so I'll never be denied,
Tryin' to succeed and reach my goals despite all the haters lies,
Know they wanna see me down, but I'ma reach my destiny,
Grateful for the blessing that come down so naturally,
I used to rock the free show, but now they pay me when I flow,
So when they try to play me, haters better run and go,
Ain't out here just flexin', I grind every single day,
Throwin' shots that break the odds, but they still remain to say,

Chorus
That even though I'm not where I wanna be,
Thank you Lord cause I'm not where my haters want me to be,
Troubles on my way, but I'mma never give up on me,
Gonna stay strong and stay focused cause I want the victory,

Verse 2
They said I wouldn't make it, but look at me now,
I'ma be the example of how far you can take it when you believe,
Paying homage to the greats that came before,
Spreading love and motivation for the next man to explore,
My will is strong and I'm so motivated,
Ain't caring what the haters say, don't wanna hear no debates,
Living in the moment, focused on my future plans,
Givin more than what I receive, keep the faith in my hands,

Chorus
That even though I'm not where I wanna be,

Troubles on my way, but I'mma never give up on me,

" i can t feel a thing just like you promised i was always bad at being good

Verse 1
I'm not broken, I'm a diamond
Let's all go home and write our rhymes
Where's my head? I'm not sure
Nobody loves the things that we endure

Chorus
Everyone is going crazy, no control
Its not my fault that they'll be sorry when I roll
Scared to life, a painless death
Make sure they know I love them right before I take my last breath

Verse 2
I can't hear your screaming it's too loud
All of my ideas become perfect little clouds
Fold me in, tucked away
I'm thinking I'll never learn what I need to know today

Chorus
All things pass, we bruise the skin
Holding onto things that we should never let within
Make them proud, dredged in guilt
Call me when the miracle becomes just coincidental

Verse 3
My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised
I was always bad at being good
There's no hell more harsh than memories, no home more vacant than an empty nest

Chorus
Winter takes the warm away
Spring takes the cold away 
Summer takes the rain away 
Fall took the one I loved away

Bridge
I believe never a place better than right here where we are
Imagining an afterlife can help us mend a broken heart
And when someone's gone, it can be a way of coping with the loss
But I don't need you out there in the cosmos, if I have you in my thoughts

Verse 4
I don't envy those in a situation that they're forced to choose
Pull the plug or not, I can't tell if it's for me or you
I know you're getting weary, tired and confused 
Sometimes letting the tired go to sleep is the best thing to do

Chorus
I will hold your head while the doctor sticks the needle in
I'll always remember our companionship and all that it has been 
And on that Sunday, October the 5th, you took your last breath
You will be missed, I'll take that to my death

My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised 
I was always bad at being good, I was always bad at being good
I was always bad, but I'll make it through, like I always said I would",rap

Verse 1
My feet stuck in the mud, I'm just trying to show love
As I'm searching for answers to the question ""What's above?""
My heart heavy with pain, the tears I cannot control
I'm looking for a sign, just to help restore my soul

Verse 2
Nobody ever said this was easy, just that it was hard
I'm standing here holding a broken heart amidst the debris that's charred
I'm stuck in this void, feeling lost and incomplete
Swallowed up by a deep sadness, I can't seem to get free

Chorus
My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised
I was always bad at being good
There's no hell more harsh than a memory

Verse 3
I'm not sure what tomorrow holds and the darkness is quite scary
I'm trying to think of a way out, something that will make this pain not so heavy
But it's hard to see a future ahead when the surrounding is blinding me
But I'm determined to find the strength within, that's been tucked away deep inside of me

Chorus
My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised
I was always bad at being good
There's no hell more harsh than a memory

Verse 4
So here I stand, trying to stay strong in this storm
I know that I'm not alone and my pain is shared and known
I'll keep pushing forward, until I am whole again
And the darkness will not win against the light in me, amen",rap

Verse 1
On the run, schemin' and ploting, 
Evil eye on the mission and not stoppin'.
His facade is everything, so you can't tell, 
Will he be good or will he be dwelling in hell?
Walking amongst the innocent and blind,
Tricking and deceiving, no one can find.
Condemned to deceive, that's the way he likes it,
For the streets to come alive with all the guns and fights.
Beware of who's next in sight, 
Cause Loki's playing tricks again, Loki's playing tricks again.

Chorus
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Wicked schemes and maliciousness, 
Loki's playing tricks again.

Verse 2
Prowling through the darkness, spreading his mischief and lies,
His darkness is endless, as no one can defy. 
Gunning and aiming to execute his devious plan,
His malice and hatred gaining more than he can.
Loss of control leading him to insanity,
No one can stop him, so humanity weeps in agony.
Uncontrollable powers, no one can prevent,
Loki's playing tricks again, Loki's playing tricks again.

Chorus
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Wicked schemes and maliciousness, 
Loki's playing tricks again. 

Verse 3
His ""jokes"" bring destructive chaos and death,
No one can understand the burden of his breath.
Gripping the darkness with a devilish grin,
He knows he's won and a new evil shall begin.
Unpredictable mind and heart of ice,
He's here to stay as he's playing tricks again, Loki's playing tricks again.

Come along and take a stroll with me
I need all of y'all to see what I see
Time is short and I must hurry
It's a trek that I must carry
Through this land of hope and despair
Lookin' at what's really there
See the people livin' on the street
How it's making their life so bleak

Chorus 
Come and take a walk with me
See what I'm going through, can you feel it?
See the truth for yourself and you will see
Come and take a walk with me
If you got time to take a tour with me
Pay attention as I open this door with me

Verse 2
I'm seeing things that I don't like
I'm cautious and feelin' overwhelmed all night
Can't trust these people that I meet
Cause they all got they own ulterior motives
So I'm stuck trying to figure it out
Thinkin' to myself if this is what it's all about
My friends don't know who I am anymore
And it's makin' me feel hollow and so sore

Verse 3
From the club to the church I try to find a way
To show these people that I'm still the same, I just changed
Went from a nobody to somebody real
But on these streets they just don't know how to feel
They see me with a mic, causin' a uproar
Now all these people don't know what's right or wrong no more
And I'm trying to stay strong in this ever-changing scene
Cause this life ain't what it used to be

Come and take a stroll with me,
I want y'all to see what i'm going through,
And I need some opinions of reality,
So if you got time, just a walk with me.
Wait a minute now,
Things ain't like they used to be,
So take a walk and help me see,
My version of reality.
Pay close attention to what I say,
These opinions, I'm trusting you with today,
Cause I don't want to make no mistake,
So let's take a walk and you can make sure I'm straight.

I'm seeing a couple of things wrong,
Sometimes I can't tell what's real and what's wrong,
And I got a feeling that these days ain't done,
So come with me and take a look at what I've become.
Introduce you to my friends and see if you notice,
Are they loyal or is this a faux pas,
Cause these snakes and I are no longer cool,
Not since I got signed, I can't even tell who's true.

These niggas in my hood say they don't like my style,
But that's cool, cause the labels felt my vibe miles,
Where before they didn't even know I existed,
Some cats here ain't even proud of what I've achieved.

Let me know how strongly you feel,
Will I be needing my weapon just to stay real,
Should I carry a pen, write down every suggestion,
Cause in Jersey City it ain't safe, can't make no exceptions.

It's like I can't even trust people close to me,
My baby mama, my boy, is this really how it be,
Is it love or just a different kind of greed,
It's like I'm paranoid, can't tell what they need.

I don't know how I feel anymore,
Ever since I got signed, I can't tell what's real anymore,
These same execs that wanted me,
Don't even care about me, just want to see some spins.

And I don't know how I feel anymore,
Ever since I got signed, I can't tell what's real anymore,
So if you feel me, walk with me,
Cause I could use the help if you see it fit.",rap

Lyrics:
They call me a jerk but I'm just here for fun
My reputation precedes me but I ain't no chump
They know I'm noisy on them streets and layin' up
But I'm just tryin' to get by, ain't no one's gotta shut me up
So I keep doin' the music, got me in a flurry
From east coast to west coast, keeps us in a hurry
Got a bit of fame and I'm livin' it large
Gettin' wild and crazy 'til the break of dawn
So what if I'm out of control at times?
I'm just livin' it up, enjoyin' my prime
Go to the shows, mingle with fans
And then head to the bar to put shots in the cans
From Hollywood to Tennessee, I'm all over the place
Gettin' love from the people and for that, I give thanks
From Rick James to Motley Crue, peace to 'em all
Just keepin' the masses entertained, I won't fall
Got these 15 minutes of fame, gotta hold on tight
Gonna make the most of it, learn from the mistakes of others, let's ride
It's all about the hangovers and late checkout
Gettin' kicked outta clubs, livin' it up with no doubt
No one said it's easy, but it's all worth it
Out in the world, tryin' to make some hits
From the el rey, to the ogden theatre
Just me and the mic, that's how it's supposed to be
With all them cameras, it can be a bit daunting
But I don't play no games, doin' it with no doubtin'
So if you see me out be sure to snap a pic
Cause ain't nobody gonna tell me when I'm done with this
Livin' life to the fullest, I'm gonna Jurney
Never gonna regret it, we gotta keep it goin'
Package the kids face, put it on display
Another national disgrace, wild and livin' it crazy
Gonna keep doin' me, no sense in hatin'
We gonna keep on chewin' the fat, till we can't take it
Hey paparazzi, don't you wanna watch me?
Gonna keep it real, never gonna deceive thee
So what if I'm a little reckless?
Gonna find my dreams, come on, let's enjoy this!",rap
"

They call me a jerk, but I'm just doing me,
I'm rockin' mic in the studio and on the street,
I'm livin' large, that's why they always take my seat
My art of living will never be complete

My lyrics are hard, but I never bite my tongue,
I get it poppin' with an infectious song,
Still livin' large, soaking up the sun,
My 15 minutes of fame have just begun

Haters on watch, wanna knock me down,
But I'ma keep rockin' with a real clown
So they can keep gossiping and put me on blast
But I'm still makin' moves and havin' a blast

I'm rapping for cash, living the life I choose,
To rock the mic, my rhymes got juice,
I'm comin' up on the scene, you should pay me mind,
I'm gonna make it big, that's how I'll find my shine

Got my shades on, looking real cool,
My rhymes are tight, I'm like a jewel,
My rap is fresh and it's phat,
So turnt up, I'm like a rat

Peace to Rick James, Anna Nicole Smith,
Bill Clinton, Motley Crue, whoever you wish,
This goes out to learning from the mistakes of others,
Bring it on, come on, I said come on, I said come on!",rap

Yeah life is like a movie with a script you can’t control,
You’re tryna make it through and find a way to stay whole,
But when the cameras stop, you’re alone and left to cope,
And stuck in a position wishing you were somebody else instead of you.

You want to be a star, but you know the world is cold and harsh,
You try so hard but your efforts, they never get that far,
It all seems like it's set up for failure from the start,
But when the credits roll, the show ain't playing anymore, it's gonna fall apart.

So baby, get the lighter, fill the bathtub with some gas,
Take a kitchen knife and cut your beloved arm off in a flash,
Put the key in your old truck, start the engine and drive away,
As you leave you realize this dead end life is over, no more horrible today.

This horrendous life is over, this horrendous life is done,
This horrendous life is gone, but it ain't ever fucking over, no it ain't ever fucking done.
Grab the wheel and take a chance, try to make a brand new start,
Remember life isn't done, you can always find a way with a little heart.",rap
" 

Verse 1
You think the world's in your hands but life ain't that kind
It's like a book full of secrets, still hard to unwind
You wanna be a star but the truth's hard to take
'Cause all that's left is regret, your dreams you can't make

Chorus
So baby get the toaster, fill the bathtub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall
Or turn your keys in your Ford Focus and as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

Verse 2
Every day you're trying hard, but it's always the same
Your world never changes, you're still in the same game
You want to find a way out but you just can't escape
What's worse than a dead end? Nothing left to save

Chorus
So baby get the toaster, fill the bathtub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall
Or turn your keys in your Ford Focus and as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

Verse 3
Now you can't go back and find that lost time
All those moments you wasted, feeling so sublime
At least you still got your life, it's all you need to live
You can't give up, stand tall and try to give

Chorus
So baby get the toaster, fill the bathtub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall
Or turn your keys in your Ford Focus and as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

Verse 1
Grind down to the trap house lookin for the person
Got one mission and that is disposin' my opposition
Work like I'm a gangster, but I'm just rappin' for the Internet
Just keep whippin' that wurzel, I got a circle so select
Don't come around if ya cameras is near
Up in the crib, keepin' it all in gear
Clean white money and a little persil
Money gettin higher, while I'm with Virgil

This ain't no practice, I'm the real deal
Big gun like Rick, livin' with Hershel
Gangster gangster, link up with Lisa and Jackie

Gotta buck one banker, play Ken, but a badman Branka

Verse 2
Grabbin' and swervin', turnin' and burnin'
Gettin' to work, like a Kermit, grabbin' and firmen'
Slangin' that Sherman, if I gotta burn
I'ma grab that burner, link up with Buck and Alex in Berlin
Gravity surfin' with all that cavities hurtin'
Man of no mercy, been murkin'
Man are all actors, but now we're convertin' 
Man was all talkin', now we're reversin'",rap

Verse 1:
Whippin' excursion, oh shit I've gotta pick up that person in the trap house
Whippin' that work and you know I'm a real badman I got the gat in my hand
Grabbing that German whip, slanging that Sherman and if man gotta burn then fuck it I'm grabbing that burner
Margiela on my feet and I'm with the Don, flippin' that kush and I'm getting it gone
Ya nah dat man stand for, I'm in an HSB, I just linked up with buck and I'm with Alex in Berlin
Gravity surfing, cavities hurting, man of no mercy, man have been murkin'

Mrs in the crib, you know I'm keeping that fertile
We don't take pictures, you know I'm keeping that personal
White so clean you know I'm flipping that Persil
Soon be the million dollar man like I'm living with Virgil
Real shit this ain't a little rehearsal, big gun like Rick, it's like I'm living with Hershel
Spitting that fire, got it from the source, I'm the yungest in the trap, but I'm the one they endorse
Banging that Kermit, you gotta grab it and firm it
Got a million in my pocket, man don't even try it

Verse 1:
Ain't no stopping me I'm a leader of the pack
I'm here to spread the message a grand plan to attack
The problem at hand lack of knowledge lack of understanding
A barrier of sorts to the ideas we're expanding
It's time we all got together and addressed the situation
What's the truth, the essence, our position and our mission?

Chorus:
So don't be afraid of what you don't know
Let's take this chance to make things grow
Franklin Delano Roosevelt said not to fear
Let's take his words and make it clear
Take precautions, don't be fooled by what appears
Complex situations might bring us tears
But history shows, young minds will come around
Model citizens with no fear of the ground
God bless this great nation, this is the sound!

Verse 2:
Open your eyes and look around at what we've become
A powerful force, with voices that can not be outdone
It's time to leave the isolation, paranoia and fear
A worthy cause to make it all very clear
Be wise and vigilant with the knowledge that you acquire
Set forth your path, be guided by the desire

Chorus:
So don't be afraid of what you don't know
Let's take this chance to make things grow

Verse 1:
Standing in front of the crowd today,
Ain't afraid of a thing, feeling so brave,
From my viewpoint I truly do saw,
The look of hope on their face, they seem so in awe.

That's why I took the mic from the stand,
And told the people bout the plans that I had,
To help the youth, so we don't lose the old,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fear has grown cold.

Chorus:
Paranoia is a disease, be careful who you trust,
A wasted mind is no good, don't let that be a must,
For the youth of today, be sure to pass the word,
Get them on the right track, no more being deferred. 

Verse 2:
From the podium I could feel the intensity,
Answering questions, giving clarity,
Cause what I'm trying to do is really quite grand,
And all should listen, this message is grand.

Won't let anything come between me and success,
Gonna give these people something they can digest,
A youth revolution, a chance of a new,
Time to take the reins, let our voices be heard.

Chorus:
Paranoia is a disease, be careful who you trust,
A wasted mind is no good, don't let that be a must,
For the youth of today, be sure to pass the word,
Get them on the right track, no more being deferred. 

Verse 3:
So come on people, let's make this thing work,
We just gotta show 'em what happens when its done right,
The future of the nation lies in the kids hand,
So everyone join together, take a stand.  

Rise up and be seen, show the world you mean business,
Before you know it, everyone'll be reminiscing,
A new dawn of the youth, something to admire,
So grab onto this dream, set this entire world fire. 

Chorus:
Paranoia is a disease, be careful who you trust,
A wasted mind is no good, don't let that be a must,
For the youth of today, be sure to pass the word,

Verse 1
Everybody gather round now, I'mma paint the picture clear
Of what be creepin' 'round at night when it's midnight round here
Ya neva seen a sight like it, so tight it'll send chills down your neck
Some things lookin' sharp, some with fangs and some no even got no skin yet

Chorus
So we gots to hightail it out of here when the spooks take ova the night
Demons round the corner just waitin' fo' their frightful jamboree to start
The headless horseman's at the top, the one they fear the most
Ya better run if you don't wanna be a headless one, that's right

Verse 2
So now you know the full story, all the creatures come out at night
It's bad enough when they start to party, but it's even worse when the headless one strikes
He's scourin' for a new head, for his old one he got cursed
It don't matter if it's tiny, big or wearin' a wig, it's head he's lookin for at first

Chorus
So we gots to hightail it out of here when the spooks take ova the night
Demons round the corner just waitin' fo' their frightful jamboree to start
The headless horseman's at the top, the one they fear the most
Ya better run if you don't wanna be a headless one, that's right

Verse 3
No matter how scared you are, you should try to make a run
When he comes by you looking fo' a new head, try to head straight to the bridge over the river son
Cause once you cross that bridge take a look back ova ya shoulder
The headless horseman hangs up his curse and the music stops, he's gone in the blink of an eye

Chorus
So we gots to hightail it out of here when the spooks take ova the night

Verse 1
Now let me tell you a story about a spook that's cursed
From the bowels of Hades, the headless horseman burst
He's searching for a head to swap, he don't get no respect
He's so unappreciated, he's ready to give it all up

Chorus
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So make for the bridge with all your might
For once you cross that bridge, his power ends tonight!

Verse 2
He takes no prisoners, riding through the night
He'll take your head if you don't make it to the bridge in time
He'll take it if its little, or big, or if it's red
He's on the prowl to find a head and there's nothing he won't do to get it

Chorus
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So make for the bridge with all your might
For once you cross that bridge, his power ends tonight!

Verse 3
The dead are up to no good and Halloween night is when
They get together for their jamboree, so you'd better listen in
There's demons, banshees and ghosts, so beware and take care
Be sure to make it to the bridge before the headless horseman's there!

Chorus
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So don't try to figure out a plan

No spooks like a spook who's spurned

Verse 1
You say one thing, do another, don't know which one to trust
You've kept your head low, love a lie more than the truth
You said the sky but the ground is all that I see
Everytime you come around you try to bring me to my knees

Chorus
So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

Verse 2
You said that you would stay, but said goodbye in the end

You said it's all love, but I see evil in your eyes
Why can't you just tell it like it is, tell me the truth and not disguise?

Chorus
So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

Verse 3
You say you care but I can see it's all just pretend

The love I felt for you was nothing but a sham
And now I'm standing here all alone, I can't believe I was so damn naive

Though you keep saying ""go, go""
Your hands still grasp me tight

Everything I had, you chose to forsake
I'm not gonna be the one that has to break

Chorus
I won't be the one to leave it in pieces
You'll be alone with your secrets and regrets
Don't lie, you promised me the sky but threw me like a stone
You embraced me with your arms, chillin' to the bone
I won't be the one to leave it in pieces

Now I'm tryin' to be brave and just walk away
But I'm still left where I always been
Your words mix like puzzle pieces, never fit the same
Why did you mislead me when some of it was true?
Your lies blindside me and I'm left feeling blue
And I'm not gonna be the one to destroy this view

Don't lie, you promised me the sky but threw me like a stone

Verse 1
God had another plan for me, to make somethin' out of nothing, my life under control, I gotta hustle 'til I find prosperity.
Gonna get it by any means, paper chase I never quit, stay up all night up in the streets stayin' true to it.
Put in work no sympathy, I don't give a damn 'bout your feelings, put in points on the board yeah that's what I'm believing.

Verse 2
My foot is on the gas, I'm never slowing down, I don't care what they say I'm gonna show 'em I'm a king in this town.
I don't need no body to get ahead, I'm gonna make it on my own, I'll never be fooled again by lies and false promises.

Chorus

Do your thing just be safe with it.

I'm gonna bust these moves, I'm gonna stay alive, no matter what I do I'm gonna survive.
I'm gonna keep fighting 'cause I'm the last of the greats, I'm gonna show the world how to be strong and unbreakable.

Verse 4
Focused and determined, don't let anyone tell you what to do, it's in your heart and in your soul, so be you.
Time don't stop for nobody, gotta take control and make it yours, hustle hard 'cause it ain't no such thing as free money.

My heart thumpin out my chest, my dreams lookin like a wreck
My enemies stalkin' my steps, I'm seein' double like I'm on deck
And I know that I'm on my own, but I don't fear the unknown
Struggle's around every corner, I'm always never alone
My friends be on some snake shit, tryna turn a deaf ear
I said peace and love to the hood, but they don't hear

Verse 2
Thinkin' back when I was young, I'd rather hit the streets with my homies
Than go to school and do my studies, man I didn't know I was so lonely
Sippin' Ripple with the OG's, tryna stay off the radar
And I remember I used to dream of the time where I could make this rap thing bigger
But I had to break free from the box, 'cause I knew that I had something to offer
So I took it to the next level, put in the work and worked it like a jobber
It got harder as I got older, had to pay bills, take care of momma
But I told myself you'll never fail without tryin' and never be a quitter

Blue laces in my blue Chucks, I never gave two fucks

Verse 3
Look at my life, look at the screams, look at the pain, look at the tears
Look at the hustle, look at the grind, look at the laughs, look at the cheers
And I said to myself, don't forget where you came from, never forget your purpose
Dust off your shoes, pick yourself up, and keep it movin', don't lose your focus
Victory to me is when you get your mind right, thinkin' and dreamin' of life
Inspiration to stay true to the game, doin' what I do, a real hustler's life
And I'll keep it real, I'ma do my thing, rep for the hood and the upper echelon
At the end of the night, no matter the fight, I'ma look for the diamonds in the sky",rap

Man man, I'll tell ya, I don't know what to say
That's how it's goin' down, creepin round the way
Ridin' in my old school Lincoln, takin' shots of Hennessy
Music bumpin loud, no need for company
Peepin out the window, man I had to stay alert
Lookin for some girls to holla and flirt
Lookin for a come-up, ain't no time to rest
Searchin for a way to stack up a fresh check
I hopped out in the street, smokin' on a joint
Gettin loose and keepin' it trill, I'm never disappoint
Throw ya hands in the air, if you rock with me
We don't need friends cause we livin' life carefree
I made my way to the club, time to make some pick-ups
Drinkin' lots of liquor, I'm feelin' kinda lit up
Shakin' it with a dime, I can tell she dig me
She wants the rough stuff, I'm gonna hit it quickly
It's kinda late, so I parked the Brougham
Time to take her back to the hotel and let her explore what I have
Headed straight to her room, layin' it on the bed
Time to make moves while the bass is pumpin in my head
Hit the lights and that's when the freakin' began
Gettin' real wild, the freak was too much for the man
Call it a night when the sun started to beam
Back out to the street, for the mission I must dream
Back to my mission, back to my mission
Lookin' for the green, strugglin' for the bread
Takin' out my foes, leakin' out the dread
Stickin' to the plan, no time for mistakes
Gettin' closer and closer I'm sees a way to escape

Reachin' out for the light, got rid of the cash
Mean muggin' all who come in my path
Gatherin' my team, searchin' for more dough
No time to lose, got to keep that flow
Dippin' and dodgin', tryin' not to get caught
Let 'em talk, just cause they mad they can't stop
Goin' hard, never give up the fight
Always reachin' for the dream, takin' over the night

Back to my mission, back to my mission
Rollin' with my squad, doin' our thing
Spittin' hot fire, nothin' but the cream
Workin' for the bread, never break the bank
Still in the field and not a penny to thank
Money comin' in, livin' the real life
Takin' it to the limit, never runnin' from strife
Makin' moves, no time to rest
Ain't nothing stoppin' me, I'm just doin' my best
Gettin' closer to the top, the ultimate goal
Ain't no turnin' back, gotta keep control
Back to my mission, back to my mission",rap

Bringing in cash flow never slackin' it's facts
Put it in the bank or put it in my stash
And make sure that I'm fresh when I'm riding in my '83
Pull up at the club and I'm dripping in gold
From my chains to my rings I'm always rockin' a show
Steppin' out the whip like I'm ready to rage
I'm look'n like a king like I'm found in a cage
My girls they know me wherever I go
They always comin' around just to get a dose
Of the way I move when I'm steppin' out
Gettin' money from the east to the west I'm 'bout
I grab my hoe come the club around eight
Start the evening off with a blunt and a plate
Hit the floor with the homies and we movin' it fast
Get the crowd hype and we bout to have a blast
My pimp talk is always on point it's so true
I'm that dude thats always puttin' in work
From the low key spot to the local strip joint
I'm at the party livin' it loud, gettin' it joint
Smokin' a blunt and sippin' a drink
Get the crowd jumpin' and the DJ spinnin'
Gonna show respect and get the ladies praise
My rap flows and my rhymes gonna light the stage
Movin' the ladies with the way I'm lurkin' it
Spit that game and they know they gonna hear it
Gettin' that respect 'cause I'm poppin' out
Never stoppin' until I get it right what it's all about

I still remember the days of old,
Riding hot wheels and playing tag on the road.
From low riders to the boom box,
Spinning the Gangstarr and Kid n Play, never stopped.
It was all about reeboks and high tops,
The girls in their deep blue jeans, rocking out with the hip hop.
The neighborhood was live, never a dull moment,
Explosions of peace, love, and unity we often sent.

Time flies so fast, it's like a blink of an eye,
The rap game changed, and moved up and got higher.
We were bboys, with the bgirls,
Coming up with new moves, in our own world.
Keeping it real and never faking,
The Wu Tang Clan, Tribe Called Quest, and KRS-One, always shaking.
It's like the rides in amusement parks,

Now, all I have left are the memories of days gone by,
The physical things have faded, but the music still survives.
So, when I look back, I'll never forget,
The fact that I can still hear the beat gave me no regrets.
It's all for the love of hip hop and I will always cherish, 
May it keep growing and we'll never perish.

Droppin' rhymes I'ma keep it real, I'ma spill it out
A story of a struggle, I'ma give no doubt
So grab a seat and listen to a tale of woe
'Bout a life of crime, when those around me chose to go

I was once a king, a hustler, a G
My moves were shady, but I kept it discreet
Now I'm in the joint, incarcerated for the crime
Prayin' for the day that I could make it out alive

But I'm not alone, cuz' my fellas all stuck too
We're all facin' sentence, none of us could make it through
No actin' tough, instead we stuck to the truth
So bein' in this joint, it's startin' to get to me and you

One love, one love, oh yeah one love
One love, one love, it's what we dream of
One love, one love, yeah yeah one love
It's all we've got, hey one love

I got new rules comin' at me all day
My freedom taken away, but I don't feel dismay
Cuz I've got my word, it's the only thing I'll ever trust
Won't back down or turn around, I'll keep my head held high up

On my cell wall I've got some pictures of the past
My folks, my girls, and my crew that I knew that would last
And although I'm in here, my heart's still in the street
No need for me to cry, I'ma keep it steady, keep it neat

One love, one love, oh yeah one love
One love, one love, it's what we dream of
One love, one love, yeah yeah one love
It's all we've got, hey one love

Been here for years and it's still hard to accept
Especially when I miss my family and their visits
I got friends on the outside still keepin' it true
They hit me up with news and keep me up to date too

Life moves on but I'm still stuck in the past
I pray one day I'ma make it out and I'm free at last
So let's hit the streets and raise our glasses to the sky
So if you hear me speak, don't forget that one love never dies

One love, one love, oh yeah one love
One love, one love, it's what we dream of
One love, one love, yeah yeah one love
It's all we've got, hey one love",rap

Verse 1
I swing by the block, my homies all post up
My potnas upstate, got their own set up 
My cousin don't call, I'm itchin' to hear somethin' 
So I reach out, get a collect call from the precinct 
No more beef and pork, they got no mercy
H.U.D. steel, they want it urgent 
P.O. says ""you better check yourself""
Momma's in the hood prayin'in the 12 steps

Chorus 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 

Verse 2
Though times were tough, we were still stayin' alive
We be out choppin' game, conversatin' 'bout gettin' toast up 
Too much money, too much fame, everybody want a piece of the pie 
But my cousin, he done wild out, he was sent to a California State Prison

Bridge 
Though I can't be there, I'm havin' his back 
My pappy sent a box full of goodies, and it's a fact 
Through the good and the bad, keep the faith alive 
Shed a tear for the ones who have taken this long ride 

Chorus 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 

Verse 3
My homies still livin' life, they all doing their thing
Gettin' money in the hood, and that's everything 
Live by the lyrics, swear to God, it's all real
Sometimes I gotta keep it gangsta on a next level

Bridge 
My homies got my back, they stay true 
One love, one love, never forgot who
Yaah, one love, one love, yeah yeah yeah 
One love, one love, never forget

Back in the spot where I flow so divine
Droppin' bars so I'm shinin' like a diamond
Hit the mike with some lyrical bliss 
Stay fly when I'm speakin' like a G
My hood know what it is, my homegirls cuttin' up
Drippin' sauce like its on shut even when it’s going up
I'm just flexin' like I'm spittin’ hot fire
Neva miss when I'm kickin' that empire
Everybody going crazy when they hear me kick it 
Start to reminisce when they hear my silky wicked wit

When I'm in your town tell em turn me way up way way up
Way up way up way way way up

Yea, I can go for days with rhymes so pure
Delivering flames that's hotter than a tour
Ain't nothing like the feeling when you owning the stage
All the ladies got me feeling like a new age
My crew know I'm never trippin' when it comes to the flow
My bars hotter than the desert but I got a cold soul
Take a sip and let it hit your brain
Makin' hits when I'm in the hood cause I'm known to be insane

Haters try to get me so I had to go off
My flow too hard and won't nothing stop me ever
Spittin' bars that make 'em go so stupid
I got the keys to the city and they can never lock it
They say I'm the king and they know I'm the plug
This rap life ain’t easy, but homeboy I'm in love
Ridin' round town with the top down, yeah I drip it
And when I'm at the spot they know my name, it's a given

Verse 1:
I'm going in the studio late night, never miss a beat
I got my rhyme book and a blue loose leaf
Ain't no one gonna mess with me when they see the heat
It's time to cook up in this kitchen, frying up the street
Evil tweaks the beat and he makes it alright
Cause when he samples it's a stupid dope loop right
But that record's kinda old, we gotta clean it up tight
Try'd the rubbing alcohol, even used the ivory soap
It's still crackling, but it's so damn dope
Gonna give up and let Evil E. hit it with the fried chicken
Verse 2:
Now it's time to bring my flow to the rhyme
Gonna make it hot, get your bodies in line
Put your hands up and take the time to shine
Cause when I start rapping I put you in a daze
Beats so fire, can't be touched by the blaze
Gonna lay it down like I'm lyrically born
And my words gonna come out like a storm
Ain't no one gonna touch my crown
I'm the king of rap, gettin' props all around
Verse 3:
I'm gonna keep spittin' fire like a volcano
Gonna write the lyrics and make the beat flow
Got that funky sound, keeps the party going
So get up and move ya hips to the rhyme
It won't take much to rock your mind
I'm the G.O.A.T. so you can't deny
Gonna stay in control and never lose power
Cause I'm the ruler of this rap tower",rap

My pen and pad, I got it ready, its time to attack
Gotta get this track poppin' like a peach, off the bat
Evil E's on the beat, got the room rockin'
Gotta tune it up, better make it thumpin'
Try rubbing it down, and scrub it up with soap
Gotta get it sounding crispy and fresh, like D'Angelo's album

Chorus:
Time to hit the studio, and cut a track,
Gotta make it pop, and get the people to react
My rhyme book in hand, gotta strike while the iron's hot
Gonna make this beat jump, make it bang like a pot
Can't forget the fried chicken on the side,
Gonna munch on some while I ride

Verse 2:
Coming with the flow, its time to ignite
Gonna make this beat go hard, til the people get hype
Jump off the beat, gonna make it bounce
Take it back to the old school, like its 85
Come through with the bars, gonna have 'em impressed
Keep it on point like a ballerina's dress
Can't forget the fried chicken, its time to eat
Gonna take a break, fill up the beat

Chorus:
Time to hit the studio, and cut a track,

The valet park me when I pull up, no need for talking, they already know what's up
If a nigga don't pay, then we pull up on him, no one's getting out of this, unless you want to swim
My momma taught me, money's the key, been getting money since I was in pull ups
I got shooters, they in the sunroof, they ready to go and they do what I do
My white girls twerking Miley Cyrus, got my money up and I'm feeling alive
I'm rocking all my chains in the club, I'm getting mobbed, that's too much love
My ride's colder than the winter, the bitches wanna know where I get my mink from
Throw a party, I'm showing out, got the money, got the power, I'm the man without a doubt

My rhymes are so cold that it's like icicles on the shore
From Ye Olde England to all the way to Spain, this music's got me going to the max
Ain't nobody gonna stop me or my flow, so it's time to let them all know
That when I'm writing these bars, my words just go 'round and 'round
I can make a beat fit for a king, 'cos when I'm spinning it's the hottest sound

The rhythm takes control and my thoughts begin to unfurl
Like the wings of a dove, they spread far and wide throughout the world
My music's so powerful, it'll make your edges curl
Jump up and start to dance, 'cos I'm the king of the rap whirl

Stick with me, it's all the way to the top
I'm like a fly on the wall, got an eye on the clock
My beats are the flame and my words provide the spark
And when I'm on the mic, it's that special kind of art

From abstract ideas to nouns and verbs
My rap is way ahead of its words
Pouring out like a waterfall, my rhymes got that funk
And when I'm in the booth, I just bring it to the brink

It's the haiku and pottery, the French and the pirate
The John Waters mustache and the unicorn's might
There's never a dull moment and never a bore
My rhymes are like a wave of heat, 'cos I bring it all the more

And I'm pouring it all out with a lyrical touch
So don't just sit and watch, jump in the rap fray

See, them other guys they pay they minds to your physical features
But I can admire your body, but your mind's much deeper
And I found me a keeper, a winner and a queen

Black Mother of the Earth, you know I forever owe ya
Never gonna ignore ya cuz I'm forever loyal

Black card at the bar like I gives a f**k
Ladies shifty eyed when we walk into the set 
F**k the fellas looking jealous play that back and get wet 
Three pound at my waist shank in my sock 
You either get cut get stuffed or get shot

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
A pirate so brave on the seven seas
A mystical quest to the isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean breeze

Then we're back in the club buying up the bar
So the groupies show us love motherf**king iceman
I'm the Top Gunner heater on blast
I'm the number one stunner watch your girl cause I ain't your mister nice guy 
More like the meet you take you home and f**k you twice guy
All dressed up with nowhere to run that's how I make you feel crazy when I come 

From the day he was born he yearned for adventure
Oh Captain Jack giving them what for 
He's the pauper of the surf the jester of Tortuga
But in Davy Jones locker what lies in store

Put your hands in the air and say hell yeah
Come on Captain Jack what Johnny Depp no
From the front to the back say we count stacks
Come on Davy Jones nope giant squid wrong
Michael Bolton we really gonna need you to focus up

Roger that let me try with another film
Life is a box of chocolates and my name is Forrest Gump
Though I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
I gave Jenny all my love okay then

I'm a legal aide Erin Brockovich is my name
Then you can call me Scarface snorting mountains of cocaine
You cockroaches wanna play rough okay I'm reloaded ha ha
So put your hands in the air and say yeah yeah

Yo yo it's Michael Bolton damn what a show
The lyrics were hot and the beats were cold
From the Captain Jack to Scarface Tony
Everybody knows Michael Bolton is the only

Now the night is young and I'm just getting started
We gonna tear the roof off the club like brokenhearted 
Mama always said life's a box of chocolates
But now I rock the mic and the audience they watch it
So get out of my way I'm gonna be a star
And I'm gonna light up the night like a shooting star",rap

Verse 1
My life's a game I'm tryna master
The voice in my head is a drama catcher
Feelin' like I'm livin' a disaster
Paranoia's grasp is faster, faster, faster
My thoughts clashin' round in my mind
Trying to figure out what's wrong and what's right
Hear the voice of worry echoing night
It's a face I can't open or break, locked tight

Chorus
It's like I'm paranoid lookin over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Verse 2
Never want to be a puppet to this force
But it's like I'm livin' life on the short course
Gotta find my way out of this mental divorce
Feelin' like a prisoner locked behind bars, of course
My skin crawls with worry and fright
At night I just stare into the night
Every day I'm trying to do what's right
But in the end it's the face inside that's mine

Chorus
It's like I'm paranoid lookin over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Verse 3
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a slave
To this fear of the unknown I've been given
Gotta take back control like a wave
Cause in the end, livin' with fear is just a prison
So I close my eyes, I take a deep breath
Tell myself I'm gonna conquer this mess
Say goodbye to the pains that test
And I keep going with the face inside of me

Chorus
It's like I'm paranoid lookin over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin",rap

Verse 1:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
All these fears and paranoia,
I'm drownin' in a sea of sorrow
What stressed me first or how the pressure was fed?
I'm tryin' to keep my head above water, like I'm treadin'
Had a voice in my head that I could not ignore
A face I held inside, like a ghost right at my door
It laughed at every mistake, every time I'd fall
It was like a devil chasin' my steps, not gonna let me ball

Chorus:
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Verse 2:
The pressure was on, I felt so stressed
Everybody had a face they held inside, but for me it was the best
The face inside was like a curse, wakin' every time I'd dream
The face inside was laughin' every time I'd scream
I heard it laughin', but I couldn't control my fear
The only way out was to get away from here
So I looked for a way, a way to let it go
So I made a choice, and I started to grow

Chorus:
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Bridge:
It's like I can't fight what I hear within
It's like the face I hold inside is right beneath my skin
The sun goes down, I feel the light betray me
I'm tryin' to block the sound of the face inside of me

Outro:
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back

[Verse 1]
I was out of it, had a one-track mind
Rocking on my grind just to make some time
Had to get back home to the city I love
Ain't had time to rest when hell's rising above
So I said a prayer, had a puff of smoke
Ate a plate of greens just to stay afloat
Hit the streets like I'ma kill the beat
Cause it's all too familiar, I'm a king of deceit

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day in the hood
Beautiful day for the fam
Won't you come and be mine
Good morning sunshine

[Verse 2]
Lifestyle on lock, high speed no stops
Let the bass drop and the beats rock
Profiling in style, briskin' to the store
Ain't no time for sleepin' when money's to be earned
Living good, yea I can't complain
Feeling like a king, always standing in fame
No time for passed out nights
Right or wrong, I got to keep it tight

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day in the hood
Beautiful day for the fam
Won't you come and be mine
Good morning sunshine

[Verse 3]
Gotta stay focused, dynamite dreams no joke
Hustling hard, got a fire in my soul
Buildin' my empire, don't care who's wrong or right
Watch me turn it up, gimme some neon lights
Been doubted but never stopped striving
Livin' high, rollin' dice, all that I'm reviving
Riding solo, but it's all good because
I'm surrounded by love, it's my beautiful hood, yo",rap

Chorus
Gotta get my fill when I feel myself
I'm talking morning sex, man, I need it like hell
Living the single life with no one to call
Gotta stay positive, no matter how small

Verse 1
My head's in the clouds, my feet on the ground
I'm looking for someone just to lay me down
Ain't no girlfriend, ain't got no wife
Ain't no friends around, 'less there's trouble in sight
I'm walking alone on the dark side of town
And I ain't sure if I'm gonna make it back around
So I keep my eyes looking for that special someone
Who knows just how to make me feel warm when I'm feeling low

Verse 2
Open my window I see the starlight
The way it shines just makes everything feel so right
I get dressed and head to the club this evening
I'm on the prowl, hope I might find something interesting
My heart is pounding, man it feels like thunder
Ain't afraid to make a move, yeah I'm feeling hungry
I see her in the corner, she's so beautiful
She smiles and my soul feels like it will never cool

Chorus
Gotta get my fill when I feel myself
I'm talking morning sex, man, I need it like hell
Living the single life with no one to call
Gotta stay positive, no matter how small

Verse 3
She took me back to her place, nothing else to do
We laid there talking, can't believe it was real
Took her hand and moved in closer, just felt like a dream
My heart was beating faster, felt like everything was about to change
We talked for hours 'til the sun began to rise
We tried to sleep but we just couldn't deny it
Finally she spoke and said, ""Let's just roll the dice
Let's make something real, something beautiful and nice""

All these politicians plotting for votes on the street
Money and power, it's all about greed
And every single day there's something I have to read
A tale of sorrow, a sorrow that I can relate
Feelin' like I'm at the bottom, 'bout to make a break
Everyone around me is starting to debate
Screamin' for change, but it's always too late

Chorus
Fallin away takin' the fall
Can't find no peace, nothin' at all
Will we ever change, no takin' it back
One step forward, two steps back

Verse 2
Eyes on the prize but the truth is so hard to find
Ain't nobody gonna tell us what's right or wrong this time
Follow the leader and take the easy way out
Or rebel and break the boundaries we been living without
Caught up in the system that's been put in place
Trying to overcome it but it's hard to race
Got to take a stand, make a difference in this world
Wrapped up in a bubble, tryin' to break the mold

Chorus
Fallin away takin' the fall
Can't find no peace, nothin' at all
Will we ever change, no takin' it back
One step forward, two steps back

Verse 3
I'm starting to see a light, a silver lining for us
Make sure our voices heard, 'cause we can't be silenced
The fire burning inside, it's time to ignite
Things are gonna improve, if we just put up a fight
No more standin' in the shadows of oppression
Stand up, march on, come on, make a confession
Fight for the future, every single one of us
Rise up, don't give up, 'cause it's time for us to discuss

Chorus
Fallin away takin' the fall
Can't find no peace, nothin' at all
Will we ever change, no takin' it back
One step forward, two steps back",rap
" one way or another one time or another

Chorus

I see the smoke of burning bridges pourin out of sight, 
I feel the weight of broken dreams still heavy in my mind, 
I hear the cries of hatred in the air each and every night, 
So I pray we find a way to get us out this fight. 

Verse 1

I see the lies of politicians as they play their games, 
Oh how I miss the days when words still held some weight, 
My past’s been an experience I’d rather forget,
So much of life still remains a regret. 

I feel the pain of a life that’s never been loved, 
The struggle is real still trying to rise above, 
From failure, I’ve learned it’s not the way to go, 
I still find a way of hope through all my woe. 

Chorus 

I see the smoke of burning bridges pourin out of sight, 
I feel the weight of broken dreams still heavy in my mind, 
I hear the cries of hatred in the air each and every night, 
So I pray we find a way to get us out this fight. 

Verse 2

I hear the roar of violence and the crowd’s approval, 
They long for more blood and now I just want closure, 
The world’s a mess and I’m just trying to make it better, 
We can’t hide from the truth, it’s not just a letter.

I see the light of a new day shining from the east, 
It’s a sign of hope and peace standing in defeat, 
This world that we live in is full of love and hate, 
I hope we find the courage to bring us to a higher state. 

Chorus 

I see the smoke of burning bridges pourin out of sight, 
I feel the weight of broken dreams still heavy in my mind, 
I hear the cries of hatred in the air each and every night, 
So I pray we find a way to get us out this fight.",rap

I'm doing a hundred on the freeway, sippin' lean in my cup
They say the world's a game, but I'm playin' to win, man I'm tryna make a buck
Cris Dinero got the keys to the whip, and I'm always ready to pop
Flippin' work, I'm in the kitchen, diamonds dancin' out of the pot
If the cops try and come, my boys keep it real, they never back down
Catch me on the block, with the biggest of blocks, money never runs out

Every day it look like an illusion, I was cruising down the highway to hell
But my demons told me cool it, Lord forgive me for my sinning
My niggas never choosy, if I'm riding then I'm sliding
Windows tinted, blowing lucies, I'mma show them boys my style

Pull up in that foreign, diamonds shining like there's no tomorrow
My pockets got fat, when I'm low I just add more
Catch me in a drop top, regular bitch, but I don't mind at all
I'd rather get rich then get stuck in the street life and take no falls
My homies always keep it real, it's just life in the game
Body full of tattoos, but I never act insane

Mama said to stay away from the bad, stay focused on the stacks
Got me rockin' the mic, yeah the world is mine
Cris Dinero on the track, yeah my lines are fine
I'm just tryna stay alive, and keep the drama of the street away
It's the only thing that I know, can save me from the grave

Chorus: 
Move too fast yeah I know, I probably move way too fast 
Yeah I know, I probably move too fast 
Yeah I know, I probably move way too fast 
But truth is I would've waited for you.

Verse 1:
I can't help the way I feel and even though you wanted out 
You never let me know about the doubts 
Without a warning everything was in a daze 
I felt so blind, no way to escape 

But your love was something special and I knew it from the start 
We both knew that we wouldn't be apart 
Now I'm stuck in a world of confusion and pain 
I don't know how I can love you the same

Chorus:
Move too fast yeah I know, I probably move way too fast 
Yeah I know, I probably move too fast 
Yeah I know, I probably move way too fast 
But truth is I would've waited for you

Verse 2: 
My heart still aches like I'm stuck in a maze 
I take a step back and think of our days 
Just when I thought we were heading the same way 
My world all of a sudden changed, I can't keep up 

I loved you as hard as I can and now I'm regretting 
All my feelings were real, but were you just setting me up? 
My dreams shattered down, I'm so broken
Now I'm left with these words unspoken

Move too fast yeah I know, I probably move way too fast

Verse 1
I move too fast yeah I know I probably move way too fast
But truth is, I woulda waited for you, don't let this get to your head
But no girl could ever take me away from you, and all my friends say I'm stuck on you
See, I hate to love you yeah, see I just move too fast
So I couldn't end up stayin' for you, they say the only way to know that love is real
Is when you hate each other, they say the only way to know that love is real
Is when you hate each other

Chorus
Yeah, see I just move too fast
So I couldn't end up stayin' for you
I know I move too fast, couldn't have a future with you
When you stuck in the past, it's like you let go, I started getting attached
I put you first, you said I'm just like your last, damn, that's when I start thinkin' to myself

Verse 2
Did you even care or was I lost lookin' for a love that wasn't there
In a world full of snakes, I was real to you, you'll never know how I feel for you
I'd kill for you, but I was your cure, you were my disease
I was saving you, but you were killing me, I seen a person in you that you couldn't see
But you just wanted me to be someone I couldn't be

Chorus
Well love is like a rose, flawless to the eyes
Beautiful at first, but eventually it dies
Truth brings pain, but that's beauty in the lies
So I'd rather be lied to than feel this emptiness inside

Verse 3
Had to subtract my ex's, you the one in my equation
But why you let 'em divide us over somethin' they were sayin'?
I don't get it, love you push away, but say you miss my love
Gave you all I had, made me feel like I ain't give enough
Said you'd never quit on me but now you're givin' up
See I would die for you, but you can't even live for us
So now we pretend like we don't exist
But we both know it wasn't supposed to end like this

Chorus
I know I move too fast yeah I know I probably move way too fast
Yeah I know I probably move too fast
Yeah I know I probably move way too fast
But truth is I woulda waited for you
Don't let this get to your head but no girl could ever take me from you

" so i write a lyric like a fragile bird in flight and justice for us all is the goal in sight

My flow is as dark as my crown is golden
I bring truth to the masses, truth that can't be stolen
The erudite elixir - the art of being bolden
Expressions of power, control is beholden
To the beat I rock, rhythm my own nation
In legacies of us, a new gravitational station
The muse of my craft is my only companionship
My mission - saving innocents from the injustice

I'm crafting the anthems of new days born
My insights a blade, slaying dragons sworn
Of the many perils that befall the hood
My music is more than just the words I should
It's a call for action for the weak and oppressed
My pen the weapon, my rhymes the protest
Spit metaphors to chastise the corrupt
My grime anthems for the wrongs that erupt

I'm the architect of a sonic revolution
Our freedom expands with each rhyme I produce
A modern day Americana - a voice from the past
My lyrics shine like a beacon of light, they last
Rhyming the tales of the have-nots plight
In the streets, in the mall - heard through the night
From the hood to the alleys to the city lights
The hustle and the struggle still alive in the mic

My words a promise, of greater things to come
My prophetic rhymes bring a message of hope
To the outcasts who have worn their sufferings with pride
The forgotten who've been pushed aside
My rhymes tell the story of the times we live
Despair and heartache, of all we can give
My message echoes deep in the minds of men
Saying hearing, believing, the struggle must end!",rap
"


My life is a canvas, a colorful one
With rhymes I express what's been left unsaid
Every verse I spit is a piece of my soul
Cutting through the noise, I'll be forever bold

My mission is clear, but the path is unknown
It's filled with pitfalls but I'll overcome
I'm the architect of my own destiny
No time to rest, I'll never be done

Chorus:
I'm a poet, a prophet, a rebel and a king
They try to break me, but it's of no use
I'm a voice to the voiceless and a light in the dark
My story's been written, can't erase my mark

They say take what's yours and make it known
With every word I tell a story of its own
My heart's on display, there's no need to hide
Fingers still typing, I'll continue to write

Maybe they don't understand why I'm here
But I'm the one they come to when they're in despair
My struggles are the same as everyone else
My fight's been long, but my faith will help

Chorus:
I'm a poet, a prophet, a rebel and a king
They try to break me, but it's of no use
I'm a voice to the voiceless and a light in the dark

Bridge:
Spit a revolution, a silver lining in the storm
This is the power of music, I'm never alone
I'm creating a change, one line at a time
Faith and courage, I'm standing for what's mine

Verse:
My dreams are my reality, I'm a leader of the pack
My flows take it to the sky, I'll never back
They love to talk and criticize, only serving to motivate
It's a call to action, I'm ready to elevate

Just never gonna stop,
My swag's gonna be on par,

My coolness is gonna make the room boom,
My moves so sick, you'll never doubt,

My sea of fans just won't quit,

Making everyone smile when the bass is loud,
My flow fresh and cool,
Just like a dolphin diving in the pool.

But there's always something better than being fly,
You always need to give respect to your mom,
And don't forget that you love your dad.

Seven thousand days in my life and all I see is pain
Fake smiles and lies, no one is truthful, what a shame
It's hard to be different when everyone around me is the same
And when I open my mouth no one is listening but their games

I'll never have enough words to express the hurt that lies inside
But I'm finding my voice, it's enough to lift my pride
I'm learning how to love myself, and how to let go of my strife
Because once I learn how to trust, I can live a better life

I wrote this song on my soul, and I won't forget its tune
It's like a hand remind me that I'm no longer so wounded
A bigger break for my life, a faith that I must face
I'm free from the shadows and ready to embrace

Gone are the days when I'm taken for granted
My power and voice have been unhindered
No loyalty but to the things that keep me clean
From the heart I'll spread my message, so people will understand me

And even though there's salt on everything, I'm not afraid to taste
To live in peace and love, is the hope that I embrace
I'm gonna keep singing, gonna keep ringing out my lows
And no matter how hard I fall, I'll never take the blows

I'm gonna keep writing, gonna keep searching for my heart
Cause I know it's inside me, and it's never too far
I've got my favorite mini series, I'm writing it down
It's gonna show the world that I'm no longer so bound

I'm ready to rise, I'm ready to break the chains
With the light in my eyes, and the beat in my veins

Step in the arena and hear the roar 
The people come out and won't take no more 
And out from the shadows I take the floor
My raps a weapon and I'm back for sure 
Growing up in a city controlled by crime 
The bleakness of future felt like it was mine 
So I took the power of words and penned up a rhyme 
To give hope to the people and showed them the time
The streets ain't the same no more guns on the rise 
Violence and death the only reward for life 
But I won't be silent no more and cause a strife 
Letting the masses understand this isn't right 
Rap is more than just guns and dope 
It's a movement to make sure we have hope 
It's constructive lyrics and a positive approach 
To give the youth a life they can cope 
My heart is a speaker I bleed this music 
The beats in my blood I must transfuse it 
If it wasn't for this I just might lose it 
So I'm honoring my supporters and fans for their love,

I'm here to never give up the fight and stand above 
Aint no turning back we're in for the win 
Showing the people we can rise up again 
I'm gonna take it to a higher level, 
Spit fire bars for an eternal battle 
No matter what it takes or what see, 
We keep going, never stop and will never be free

To lift up the people and fight the dismay

The field of battle is not a place you go, no man is an island
And I'm searching for something, trying to find my purpose

I'm inspired, on a quest to make the world feel the heat

So come feel the fire, higher power, for we are one
In the spirit of unity, we march as one
Searchin for the truth, never gonna stop, always gonna rise
No more tears, no more fears, open up the skies

Say goodbye to all the pain, hello to a brighter day
Everybody join the jam, get ready to groove and sway
It's a life full of joy, and we gonna live it to the fullest
No more sufferin and strife, no more empty cup
Spare no expense, take a chance, just let go of the past
Time to raise the bar higher and higher, till it all collapse

Our journey is not done, so many steps still to come
Our struggles and our strife, must help us find the light
Working towards the goal to transcend our limitations
We all want to be free, so let's fight now for our liberation
One steps leads to the next, we will never rest
Till we reach the end of our journey to forever!",rap

Verse 1 
From the depths of the dark, I arise as the judge 
To condemn all who enter this realm of the grudge 
I'm the one who hears your profane confession 
So start talkin' what do you have to mention? 

Chorus 
Confess, confess, your anti-Christ confession 
The ones that have made you guilty in the Devil's direction 
Your soul is in peril and redemption is at stake 
Tell me why your actions have led to this fate 

Verse 2 
You thought you could find power in the depths of despair 
But now you know that's only wishful thinking in there 
What you've done is nothing less than blasphemous 
And no matter how hard you pray, you can't repent it from us 

Chorus 
Confess, confess, your anti-Christ confession 
The ones that have made you guilty in the Devil's direction 
Your soul is in peril and redemption is at stake 
Tell me why your actions have led to this fate 

Hook 
Your eyes can't hide what your heart claims to be true 
So don't try to deny it, your words won't get you through 
The only way out of this is to tell the honest truth 
And pray that your confession will save you somehow 

Chorus 
Confess, confess, your anti-Christ confession 
The ones that have made you guilty in the Devil's direction 
Your soul is in peril and redemption is at stake 
Tell me why your actions have led to this fate",rap

Verse 1:
Sometimes the night can be so cold and dark,
And fear can creep in and leave it's mark.
But I was foolish and I chose the wrong path,
Causing me to be found guilty of covenants with the devil I had to face the wrath.

Chorus:
Confess, confess, what could I say?
The evidence is clear so I have to state my confession.
My actions have a heavy consequence,
I must confess and the anti-Christ will make me pay.

Verse 2
A devilish deal was made, I must admit,
But I was blinded by what I thought I could get.
Realizing my mistake I stopped to think,
How can I possibly turn back to the brink?

Chorus
Confess, confess, what could I say?
The evidence is clear so I have to state my confession.
My actions have a heavy consequence,
I must confess and the anti-Christ will make me pay.

Bridge
Now I have to face the music,
And accept the consequences of my decisions.
No matter how hard I try to hide,
The truth will never be denied.

Chorus
Confess, confess, what could I say?
The evidence is clear so I have to state my confession.
My actions have a heavy consequence,
I must confess and the anti-Christ will make me pay.",rap

Lookin' for the profit I had to elevate,
Got my eyes on the prize must remain obsessed,
Came in with the flux livin' large and great,
Take my money to the bank just to show my success.

Takin' over the game gonna rep my set,
Movin' up the ladder while I mix and get,
Growin' with the hustle gonna find respect,
Stackin' up the money 'cuz I'm gettin' my bread.

Got no time to waist, I'm here to make a change
Gonna keep it moving before they know I'm in the game

Always hungry and motivated so I never take the shame

Heads up, bow down, I'm the only one that's boss

I'm turning up with these tattoos on my arm
Tear it up, leave no trace, just me and the calm
Always coming up, trying to stay ahead of the pack
Knock them out with a song and a real vicious attack 

We be in the club bad bitches got plenty riders on the way get fucked up with me feeling like pac cause a nigga sipping henny sipping henny a nigga sipping henny

Bringing it back with the funk like I don't have control

Make them bounce to the bass, put their hands in the sky

I'm tryna stay away from the bitches who wanna play me
The type of ones who keep comin back with that fake love
Tryna blow up my high and I ain't lettin her hol' me
Cuz a player like me I's only ever for the dough
If she wanna talk about a young nigga with a fortune
I can't even show her love cuz she don't need more
A girl like that only want what I'm worth
She think she sly finessin so I don't touch her first

She said she want a young G with a chain
That can make her feel real when they're askin her name
She said she wont settle until she get that fame
But no matter what I do, I can't love a bitch
No matter what I do, I can't love a bitch
No matter what I do, I can't love a bitch
No matter what I do, I can't love a bitch

Choppin up her tracks is a waste of my time
Doin it for money, not for that black diamond ring
Tryna be a baller but money ain't no thing
Still gotta be careful cuz that's where the money get
Stay on the grind, that's how you bout your change
Hit the road and stack yo money, never look for fame
Cuz if you got it, you must keep it, and hustle for yo name
Stay away from the bitches 'cause they wanna take yo change

She said she want some Xans, some ice and some louis
She said she need a G cuz ain't nobody gon choose her
She just want a nigga man who got some real paper
But no matter what I do, I can't love a bitch
No matter what I do, I can't love a bitch
No matter what I do, I can't love a bitch
No matter what I do, I can't love a bitch

She said she want that gucci, prada, fendi mane
She said she want that kanye and jigga, beyonce fame
Everything she want I just can't provide
Cuz a player like me do it just for the ride
All these bitches say they love me, I got too many hoes
But I can't love a single one cuz my hearts made of stone
I just want a couple racks and that's it for me
Now I'm back to my grind so I can finally be free

She said she want that kim k that kanye she said she want that jigga beyonce but i cant love a bitch i cant love a bitch but i cant love a bitch i cant love a bitch she said she want duane mary jane she said she want that keisha gucci mane but i cant love a bitch i cant love a bitch but i cant love a bitch i cant love a bitch

I can see it in her eyes, but I can't give her what she needs
My heart's been broken too many times, I can't get down on my knees
I'm just tryin to stay alive and ball on a real high
Doin it for the love of the game, so I can't love a bitch

Dun dun dun dun dun duh,
I got a lot of questions, I need the truth
This game of rap, what I'm in need of proof
What if I don't got a damn thing to bring
What if I can't make it rain, what if I can't sing
What if I decided to go pop, no more street
Would I get laughed at, or make that heat
What if the Girl you really wanted had a boyfriend
Would you still try to hit it, or stay away and pretend
What if I just showed up to the party without chips
Would I still get in, or just get kicked
What if I got on stage and tried to perform
But I just couldn't do it, what if I just bomb
What if I got too deep in debt and got caught up
Would you bail me out, or leave me stuck
What if I started spitting fire, and had others admiring
Would I still stay humble, and not start aspiring
What if I get caught up in a criminal game
Would you still be around, or just change the lane
What if I stepped in a room and had the ladies swoon
Would you still be my homie if I started to moon
What if I kept my mind right and got focused
Can I make it in this game, or would I be choked
What if I started greedin, and started to scheme
Would I take a step back, or continue with the dreams",rap

Dunn dun dun dun dun duh
The only way to make it happen, let's get it crackin
Who's gonna be the teacher, submit to the lesson
The only way that I can bring it to ya, is to school ya
Lesson by lesson, no time to messin, let's get it crackin
Who's gonna give the answers, let's keep it fashion

Hate on me, why do brothers bump they gums
Debate on me, why when I ride by and don't stop?
You feel I disrespected your block
If you had a top notch lezbo straight from peanuts sexin
Tell me would you hit it without protection uh huh?
Let's make it harder, what if she had a friend
Both down for nut huggin off the hen
Would you spend chips, what if I come off the ho
With six six, will I get back in the mix
Drop some grip or just quit?

What if the O.J verdict was different thing
Would we swing, start lootin and shootin with Rodney King?
If it was a fifth, would you share it with ya folks
So we could ride out and get smoked?
I wonder if I dropped a hundred dollars, would you give it back?
I wonder if we cool like that

You got three cute flees, one fine one got a job
One with patience, what would you dick for a long-term relation?
Money is the thing, fine ones can start hatin
I'm broke so I need one with patience

If I was hella dirty, look like Mr. Furley
With lint up in my curly hair would you groupie ass girlies stare?
What if I didn't have a car to skee skirt in?
Would you still be flirtin' or would it be curtains?
If you got your teeth knocked out, would you refreak the old ones
Or rush to the dentist for some gold ones?

If you had forty dollars and a hooker wanted thirty
Could we catch you out in Vegas doin' dirty?
If you got one gritty and five niggas
Would you speak on the choo choo shit to make the situation bigger?
She'll do it, but now she's on some new shit
You gotta go downtown, enjoy the fluid

How many blunts must I take to the face to be straight? Forty
If I don't got five on the eighth, would you fake or smoke it?
Get loaded or hold it like a buster to get cluster?
Should I be rollin' with big hustlers, would I take one and a heist?
Seesaw wanna bubble, but you can't keep up with the priceses
And then I ask you what if I sold a million plus
Should I renegotiate with that nigga Russ?",rap

My visions so clear and the truth is true, I got shit I gota do
Living life in the hood, feeling all the pain, but at least I'm still in the game
I could be in a gang and boost, slang and shoot
No matter what's going on in my hood, you still don't care, do you?
I got stabbed in the eye and you were nowhere to be found
You didn't give a damn when I was shot in the throat and bled to the ground
But you care when something happens in your suburbs, and that's when I've had enough
I'm gonna cut your daddy's neck, you little fucking nerd
No matter where you're from, I don't give a fuck, so don't tell me
It's all about what's going on inside your head
Do you care about the seventeen dead?

Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Do you care about the seventeen dead?

Woke with a body lying next to me, I leapt out the bed
I strapped on my kicks, and took a look in the bathroom, and it was all dead
Blood everywhere, I'm ready to kick someone in the ass 
I make a quick left onto Jefferson, and there's another stiff in the passenger seat
What's going on in my hood, what's the deal
I'd like to grab a Faygo, but all my homies are dead on the street
Straight with that, just don't leave your guts in my car
I cry seventeen tears a day, should I burn the rebel flag or the red white and blue?
I try to do something, but the fools got a death wish
I'm gonna swim in their blood to justify the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Do you care about the seventeen dead?

Dead bodies ain't so bad, they're just lying around
My dead homies don't bother me, I still drink Faygo in front of Scottie's
But I'm blowing my mind when I see I got seventeen dead bodies now
I'm straight with that, and I don't need to be scared of you
I'll cut your ass up seventeen times and you'll love it
Drive down the street and see the people who can't make ends meet
They may have been rich when they died, but they still ended up in hell
Take that to your golden bed, and I'mma cut you up for the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Do you care about the seventeen dead?

Brooklyn baby, the love is real and I'm gonna be there 
Gonna stick it to your nugget, put a little bit of mustard on it
And kick somebody in the dead ass, for sure
I'm Violent J and I'm kinda wicked, so don't think I'm not
I'm at the trailer park waiting for a check, my woman's got babies falling out her ass
But I'm still running with the carnival, until I'm eighty
Tonight I'm going out with the fat lady, and then I'll be ready for the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Seventeen dead in my barrio
Do you care about the seventeen dead?

Verse 1
Time is relentless like the ticking of a clock
My mind just won't stop, and I'm spiraling out of control
I've wasted so much, and I'm feeling so low
My faith is shallow, and I'm losing my soul

Chorus
Drown my sorrows, flood my soul
By tomorrow I'll be cold, now I'm hollow and alone
Faith is shallow, almost gone

Verse 2
Raise the stakes, what have I got to lose?
No choice in sight, where's my right to choose?
Can't catch a break so I take what I can
Just ignore the blame and don't understand

Chorus
Drown my sorrows, flood my soul
By tomorrow I'll be cold, now I'm hollow and alone
Faith is shallow, almost gone

Verse 3
Cracked picture frames, bloodstains on the mattress
Ashes to ashes, gas cans, and matches
Bourbon buries all the memories
Anything to wash it all away

Chorus
Drown my sorrows, flood my soul
By tomorrow I'll be cold, now I'm hollow and alone
Faith is shallow, almost gone",rap

Verse 1
Same old struggles I'm chasing my luck,
I thought I had it, but it was all a big one
The pain grows, but I'm too numb to feel it,
Rage overwhelms, as I slip and start to reel it
My doubts get the best of me, I'm chained to the ground,
This feeling of helplessness, I'll never be free again

Chorus
So, drown my sorrows, flood my soul
By tomorrow I'll be cold, now I'm hollow and alone
But the faith is shallow and almost gone

Verse 2
My failures don't define me, I'm my own relief
I will keep on, no matter what this life throws at me
Through the darkness, I'll find the light,
And I'll reject the lies, stuck in this fight
The only thing that's certain, I'm never giving up
Time to let go and move forward, I don't need the luck

Chorus
So, drown my sorrows, flood my soul
By tomorrow I'll be cold, now I'm hollow and alone
But my faith is strong and it can't be gone

Verse 3
I'm finding a new way, new life to find
No more wasting time, I'll take what's mine
It's hard to face the truth, but I won't forget
My struggles may linger, but I won't regret
I'm facing the world, will I stay afloat?
No more sorrows, I'm ready to go

Chorus
So, drown my sorrows, flood my soul
By tomorrow I'll be cold, now I'm hollow and alone
My faith is strong, so I'm moving on",rap

On the grind every day nonstop, even if the weather gone drop
In the studio with the team, for the hustle we all about that
Haters try to come around me, with the noise but I'm not hearing that
Living life and don't be bothered, I'm secure with the moves I make

Diamonds and pearls and rich greedy husbands, haters and fakers being hunted

They can talk their words of hate, I'm still gonna rise like a phoenix
Cos I got my destiny, I'ma continue to be far from a leech

To the top of the ladder I'm climbing, no matter what they said I'm gonna rock
These are a few of my favorite things, putting on for the hip-hop scene

Ridin through the hood with my top down, I'm tryna dodge these bullets but they all seem to follow me around. Got nuthin to lose so I'm rollin' with the punches, a never-ending loop of darkness and lunches. The shadows in my head are a daily fight, I'm livin' like I'm dyin' while trying to make it through the night. My demons thirsty and my heart is parched, I'm tryin' to run away but I ain't never gettin' far. So I smoke my way to the top of the block, to try and release the pressure like a gunshot from a glock. 

I'm ridin' in the city of the AK's bullets, with no name and I'm almost sure they'll spray. I got death on my mind and I'm ready to test my luck, hoping I can find some peace from this plague of bad luck. I'm feelin' like I'm already dead and gone, it's like I'm the ghost of who I was when this journey begun. Just a puff of smoke, now I'm nothing but ashes, jon voight incarnate and my heart just crashes. I'm tryna do better but I'm goin' way low, I'm fucken up more now than when I started off so. This junk has a hold on me like a vice grip, I'm caught in a spell, I can't fight this no more hit.",rap
"

Ridin on my own, no time for friends in need.
Lost in my thoughts, my soul never to find peace.
Head full of clouds, my mind loaded with doubt.
My sorrows roam free like a bird without a route.

Suicide on my mind, I'm teasin' fate with my luck.
Ridin' in the city of the AK's, bullets with no name, they might just spray.
Ridin' on my own, no signs of the sun to bring joy.
Ridin' with the windows up, grey as the clouds of fog.

My heart is made of stone, no more love to be shown.
Chasin' all my demons, they won't leave me alone.
I'm jon voight, ashes spread off the tip of my blunt.
My fate is sealed, it's so hard to confront.

Fuck a hoe then I'm gone, I was created from snow.
I'm livin' on a faster lane but still livin' so slow.
Ridin' in the city of the AK's, bullets with no name, they might just spray.
Ridin' on my own, no time for friends in need.",rap

Verse 1
It's hard feelin' lost, tired, and alone
I ain't even had the chance to meet him, no daddy tone
So many questions runnin' through my head
Was he stressed, did he fall out of love, or was it somethin' worse instead
The little girl left the classroom feelin' so small
And though I was not her, she was livin' inside of me, like a broken wall

Chorus
Everybody knows a hater's just a fan in disguise
They try to tell you what you're doin' wrong, don't let it faze on
This is your theme song, baby and it's goes on and on
And it goes on and on, on and on, see when the soul is empty
And you fill it up, probably will get back empty again
And you start all over

Verse 2
She don't need no one to run to, so they run through her
Tells her he loves her but it ain't true
He's doin' all the things that a daddy's supposed to do
She's got everything to lose, everything to prove
My mind tends to move, but she won't
The pain is too much for the heart to hold
I'm here to give a voice to people who were never told

Chorus
Everybody knows a hater's just a fan in disguise
They try to tell you what you're doin' wrong, don't let it faze on
This is your theme song, baby and it's goes on and on
And it goes on and on, on and on, see when the soul is empty
And you fill it up, probably will get back empty again
And you start all over

Bridge
He don't deserve your love, tell him how you feel
When you realize then you'll be right
Casper, Casper, Casper ooh
How can the ghost look in look in the mirror
And see your flaws, that's how the mirror works
She don't need to give up, that's what she believing in
And if the pain don't stop, don't worry everything's gonna work out in the end

Chorus
Never give up, never give up, never give up, never give up

" that s how the mirror works dreams don t come true unless she close her eyes `

Verse 1
I heard it on the street, her daddy's arrived
He walked right in and told the teacher he was here to pick up his daughter
I saw his girlfriend's daughter huh, gather her things
And he said to her, c'mon, let's go and they left the classroom

Chorus
And I felt so small, lonely, embarrassed and replaced
I think it made me feel, I never had a daddy
But I guess he never had a daughter either
She never been a princess and never even got a chance to meet him

Verse 2
Shoulda told her, he didn't want her
Shoulda taught her everything he knew how
How can the ghost look in, in the mirror, ohh
And see the flaws, that's how the mirror works
Dreams don't come true, unless she close her eyes

Chorus
Everybody knows a hater's just a fan in disguise
They try to tell you what you're doin' wrong
Don't let it faze on this is your theme song baby
And it goes on and on, and it goes on and on, on and on

Verse 3
See when the soul is empty and you fill it up
Probably will get back empty again and you start all over
She don't have no one to run to, so they run through her
Tells her he loves her, but it ain't true
He's doin' all the things that a daddy's supposed to do

They try to tell you what ya doin' wrong
Don't let it faze on this is your theme song

Rolling through, with the windows down
Runnin' up the scales and getting bout it

If you think you gonna rock it, then you better slow down

My pocket large, money coming in all sizes
Sparking up, can't turn away these fire signs
Ain't no use in trying to compete, I'mma elevate
My mind is so sharp, a blade can never penetrate

Can't be touched, on the grinds and I'm up late
Stay cool, when the shots fly and the beat bangs
Getting that paper, making sure my cheese is straight
Heads up if you try to beef, it's gonna get hot in this place

You can call me what you want, I'mma keep on doing me
Calling me MJG, yeah that's the way it'll be
Polo and some sneakers, loaded up with all the heat
Money don't sleep, so I'm tryna get it any way I can see

Stackin' up more than defeat and I'm tryna hit a mil
Cuttin' up the corners so you know the deal
Bands in the bank and the ladies screamin', ""Oh, how you feel?""
I stay motivated, man, no time to sit and chill
Dolla signs in my eyes and now I'm ready to kill
Gettin' to the bag, I'm ready to run a race
Never ask for a handout, I'm gon' do this on my own grace

Always livin' life on the edge, but I'd never doubt
Tryin' to make it 'fore I'm old and grey

I'm deep in the game and my skills are unmatched
I'ma never let 'em forget my name, 'cause it's brand-stamped
So get up on your feet and get with the team
Let's get this money and put it where it needs to be
And for all them haters, ""What up?"" see you later
You can keep talkin' but it's too late to get the bait
I'm doin' it big and I'm goin' the distance
Feelin' like Puff when I step up in the place and
I'm makin' moves that'll blow up the spot
Fifty zones tucked under the brougham, bet it's gonna rock",rap
"

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
This what I do, let's ride, block to block,
Ain't got time, I just drop it non-stop,
Gotta hustle, gotta stay focused,
You know I'm getting money, they see me in a black Chevy on twenty-thirds,
Split the hood with 'B' and a two, two, three,
So don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me,
Don't worry 'bout me, no need to drag my feet,
Gotta stay vigilant, this magnum's so critical,
Ain't no playing 'round here, in the Bay they gon' pop you in your spine,
Gotta stay alive, this game is so hectic,
Tips get sent around, it's so effective,
Can't run loose like a goose, 'fore ya turn to a vegetable with soup,
Don't condone it, but if ya come for my dome,
I'ma leave it in the breeze and ya won't get to home,
If money's around, I'm tryna take part of it,
That's the way that I live, that's the way I start it,
Gettin' money, flyin' around, I'm done just sittin',
Anywhere I go I got that Waka Flocka on the street and they poppin' with it,
Gotta face the Day, the Reapers drawin' near,
I'm the one they callin', got the knowledge and the fear,
Nobody know what I did, just unsolved mysteries,
Caught a flight and flew back, got his brain out his head, he gone,
Nigga, what I do? It's all for my fam-lam,
Playin' dominoes, chess, and peanuts, no ramblin',
Black Chevy on twenty-thirds, I'm through the hood with 'B' and a two, two, three,
So don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me,
Don't worry 'bout me, 'fore ya turn to a vegetable with soup, 
My nigga forty hit me up, need a favor he need,
Now or later, niggas playin' games in the Bay, I must proceed,
He told me sevens on the real, and this is for close,
Gotta tell me where he stay and make sure his ass gone,
Fly out the Day, now my mission is complete,
I blow his brains, turned him to a ghost, flyin' off the street,
Smoke like a roast, my money, I must stack,
Gotta take part of it, keep a low key, that's the way it is, no slack,
Gettin' money all around, this is what I do,
So don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me,
Don't worry 'bout me, 'fore ya turn to a vegetable with soup,
Raw, raw hustle, grind and get that money,
That's the way I do it, niggas takin' off runnin',
Black Chevy on twenty-thirds, I'm through the hood with 'B' and a two, two, three,
So don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me,
Don't worry 'bout me, 'cause I'm gettin' money non-stop.",rap

My life never been easy fine livin' lowkey
Popping wheelies in the street livin' reckless is easy
My grind don't get no rest I'm so possessive
How I'm gonna stand for my fam man no question
I'm out here daily on the mission getting this cheese
Running these blocks and I'm stacking this paper with ease
It's getting deep and I'm diving in the street
You might see me in my whip but really I'm on my feet
Chorus:
Black Chevy on 23s I'm through the hood with b and a 2 2 3
Under the seat I'm like you ain't gotta worry bout me worry bout me
I'm like you ain't gotta worry bout me worry bout me
I'm like you ain't gotta worry bout me
Got them niggas on the line callin' bout the favors I'mma deliver
And they know they'll get what they asked they will never be dissapointed
Cause if I ain't got it then it's gone be a donnybrook
And ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do so watch me now
My skills ain't something you can buy, you got to earn it
You gotta wake up to the truth, gonna take you to the limit
Ain't no time for sleep better keep eyedin' the enemies
Cause you get caught up in this game and it's nothing like the movies

Black Chevy on 23s I'm through the hood with b and a 2 2 3
Under the seat I'm like you ain't gotta worry bout me worry bout me

I'm like you ain't gotta worry bout me
Money cash and power that's how I get around
I like the way it feel to go out and get down
It's really on the daily I'm out trying to survive
So I'mma stick by my plan and take care of mine
You can see me in the hood on a mission just tryin' to score
Can you feel my pain when I'm always asking for more
Ain't no time to hesitate cause I'm always on the move
So I'mma stay on the grind till I find that one groove

Verse 1
Yeah, greetin' to all y'all, jump on the track
Gotta tell it like it is, what facts I will lack
Meet up at the spot and then I'm on the attack
Rapping raps that'll leave the haters like ""uh-oh, he's back!""
You think it's all bout cash, but girl I just need a hug
I been holdin' all this pain and I can't shrug
My heart's like an open book and you want to turn the page?
Gotta move on with my life, before my spirit goes to waste

Chorus
Gonna say goodbye, before my heart breaks
Don't wanna play no game, 'cause there's so much at stake
Gotta go my own way even if it's hard
Gonna see things through, just know that I'm prepared

Verse 2
Always had a vision that I was destined for greatness
And I know I'm gonna make it, no matter what the haters say
When it comes to you, I'ma always catch the plays
Gotta stay free, no matter what the cost will be
My message is deep, but you don't pay attention
Just another distraction, my heart needs a suspension
Gonna keep it real, a full time mission
Gonna stay strong and go in for the win

Chorus
Gonna say goodbye, before my heart breaks
Don't wanna play no game, 'cause there's so much at stake
Gonna go my own way even if it's hard
Gonna see things through, just know that I'm prepared

Verse 3
Take it all back, bow my head and say a prayer
Gonna keep pushin', 'cause I'ma take it there
Take what I got, never look back or shed a tear
Gonna stay true to myself, no matter the fear
Gonna keep grinding, just need a little time
And when its all said and done, I know I'll be fine
Gonna keep climbing, reaching for higher heights
Gonna show the haters why I keep ballin' with my mic",rap

Verse 1
Girl, what you doin' with your life? Livin' life like it's a rollercoaster ride,
I'm just callin' to say good morning, you the one that said all the lies.
Do what you need, do what you want, like a king or a queen I shoulda put you first,

Chorus
Walk away, before your heart breaks, why you even wanna start? Bae playin' games, like a pro at the arcade, don't you dare call me the dark drake, I'm sweeter than a parfait, showin' u affection in the broad day.

Fool for love but you know I'mma ride for you,
Cuffin' season and I'm still here for you.
Performing for you, I be the headline for you,
Fucking right and dem other bitches ain't no lady.
Don't want a wife, just one night, ain't nuthin' nice
You ain't nuthin' like 'em, you so indecisive, while I'm so undecided.
Yea, I'm bout to start another fire, yea, you so mutha fuckin' biased,
And you know the winters mine and the summers ours.

Back when you ain't have a ride, you was a true rider, sick of sleeping with these bitches they so tired.
I hope you spare me no fuckin' time, tell me what it is, I don't want no surprises, lookin' at me like a player a womanizer.
This shit ain't adding up, we so undivided, real recognize real, you don't recognize 'em, just walk away.

They lookin' for a king, and I'm the one they see

So what's the hold up? Bitch nigga hold up

Shots I'm ready to fire / Clip full of desire
My crew is dancing in the street / Best believe nobody gonna stop me
Cuz I'm a black smoke smurf / Who can never be ignored
Livin wild and free and then my swag is out the door

So don't test, don't make me burn ya
Ain't nothing worse than when I turn ya
From a friendly face to enemy mine, I'mma put you outta line
Cause I'm ridin with the gang and they gonna take it higher
We don't need no drama tonight, so check ya attitude and don't expire

Better be lookin out my window / or that watch will be on the floor

Smoking on that good weed, slaying with the heat
We ain't tryna hear no hoes, just keep it on the low street

Bitch nigga hold up, don't make me burn ya
Ain't nobody want that smoke, better check ya attitude and don't ya dare
Make sure you understand the rules, you know that I don't play

Livin' this life don't come with no locks
Got no time for ya bullshit, no dilly-dock

Always on the sideline, tryin' to get dice
But I'm never rollin' no seven or no nice
Livin' my life, tryin' to make it grand
Smokin' this pack, lookin' for the plan

Smokin' this reefer, hopin' it will last
Runnin' this game, livin' real fast
Choppin' this cheese, tryin' to catch a flight
To my city, where the street lights are white

Niggas think I'm blingin' but that ain't the case
Still livin' as a hustler, tryin' to keep pace
Tired of gettin' treated like a renegade
Livin' this life, don't need no blades

Choppin' it up with the homies out there
Stoppin' to see where the money gonna go

Pull it out and watch all these niggas scatter

When the money comes you see the funny ones,
Gettin' it done by the way I'm comin' from.
My light skin gal is twenty-one,
I'm ballin' like an All-Star livin' young.

At the beach puffin' on some good Jamaican rum,
Got a hundred bands if you know where it's comin' from.
Race is on to see who can get it faster,
Pullin' out stacks from my old mattress.

I'm in my own lane, I don't need the credit,
I'm in the grow game, heating up the kitchen.
Grab my money tight, I don't let it slip,
Bakin' soda in the pot make that flame lick.

Two girls both fine, drunk on some wine,
Droppin' bags, don't wanna let it go this time.
Made half a ticket off just one deal,
Drove up the Benz and bought a mansion for the thrill.

Trap talk, diggin' holes in the winter snow,
Made me rich, now I'm poppin' like some dough.
Some made it out, some still in the field,
Always stay true, keep it real or else you won't blow.

Cake in my palm, I can't let it go,
The bay smokin' up, got it from Berner you know.
Dasani bottle full of Hennessy,
Takin' shots, makin' gwop off my enemies.

Yea the hoes out here have to wait their turn,
I'm in too deep, makin' money I gotta earn.
Send another box out, hope it touches down,
Can't afford, another loss, need to stay around.

Some made it out and some still in the field,
Always stay down yeah I'm gon keep it real,
But they know it ain't good unless the pack sealed,
No no it ain't good unless the pack sealed.
Just made half a ticket just off of one deal,
If you ain't gettin' money, you a slow learner,
My whip got the horse on the wheel,

My heart it skip a beat when I see you,
Even when I'm mad, I could never leave you.
And we fight for love, cause that's what we do,
Crazy life, but you make it through.

And don't leave me left alone,
Got a better side that I never shown.
And you been stressed for sure,
When the pebbles thrown, know we set in stone.

Love is never easy, that's just a fact,
But I'm standing proud, know I won't react.
Deep asleep, I keep dreaming you and me,
Minted moments, the sweetest thing I see.

And don't leave me left alone,
Got a better side that I never shown.
And you been stressed for sure,
When the pebbles thrown, know we set in stone.
And you the rarest soul and I care for sure,
No you can't be cloned, don't leave me left alone.",rap

Verse 1:
I was born into this world, I didn't have much say
Little boy, little girl, my family here today
But there comes a time in life when you can finally choose
And when I looked real deep, it was you that I wanted to use

Verse 2:
Height or skin tone, those I can't control
But what I can do is the person I choose for my soul
It's a big decision, and I want it to be right
So I'm here to tell you, I choose you to make it alright

Chorus:
I choose you to be by my side
I choose you to hold me at night
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right
And I choose you, I choose you

Verse 3:
The family tree has many branches, each with its own roots
But the one we get to pick, the one we choose
It's our own little half of heaven, it's up to me and you
And when I looked real deep, it was your name I knew

Chorus:
I choose you to be by my side
I choose you to hold me at night
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right
And I choose you, I choose you

Outro:
And I was worried I wouldn't know what to do
If I was in these shoes
But standing here it's clearer than the sky is blue
That I choose you, I choose you",rap
"

Verse 1 
I thought I knew it all, until I stepped out in the world 
Things looked different than before I had the chance to twirl
My life in the balance, left me with a brand-new duty 
A moment to choose and make the right decision, truly

Chorus 
I choose you, I choose you for all that is true 
Our fate written in the stars, a special view 
I choose you, I choose you to stay by my side 
This feeling never fades, as close as the tide

Verse 2
The universe made us all, but choose who you adore 
Every decision comes with a risk, must take that leap and soar 
Be sure to understand the words and feel the rhythms swell 
Hand in hand with those you love, that’s how your story will tell

Chorus 
I choose you, I choose you with all of my heart 
You’re my companion, my ship to chart 
I choose you, I choose you to stay in my life 
This path we’re on is full of love and delight 

Verse 3
No one really knows the future, but we can try our best 
Continue to live with faith and hope, put worries to rest 
Decisions aren’t easy, but I’m glad that I have you 
Strength in each other, that’s a choice that’s always true 

Chorus 
I choose you, I choose you through thick and thin 
This mantra never changes, our journey together to begin 
I choose you, I choose you to be with me evermore 
This love will last forever, the path we choose is sure",rap

Rocking the mic like I'm on a mission
My style be real slick like crispy bacon
She got a body that bring in a siren
Got a temper hotter than a fireman
She a boss so she never playin'
Walk with a strut that a pimp be praisin'
Her moves will leave even the gods amazed
More curves than the Grand Canyon they be blazin'
She got class that you can't repel
Her wings so high flyin' can never take her level
Too smart to be fooled so don't even try
In her presence she's the real MVP
She don't walk out there with her hand open
Good things come to those who wait
This one ain't your mama she don't care about nobody
No class no representation
So many flavors in one package deal
Can't go wrong with her type of meal
Tall six foot five woman for this short man to fill
He's only 67 but still got a long life to find
When she on the wood she give oral like she a pro
Bags from her past life she can never let go
Got bullets for a target the gun know me well
Covering the east but she off the chain globally
Never be touched and always stays true
She claim a mathin man and a wonder doll too
She keep him floored with her iron snake on three rims
Like the snake in her bird tail she keep him addicted
Fan of large and member of the same
Give it to her like that fool sucker for a name
On the track watch out don't turn your back
Cause when she comin' you must watch attack
Watch out she's a train wreck
Met at Star Bucks sipping Frappuccino
Grind on her like coffee bean a couple cups
She swing on chandeliers for this man to see
Smooth skin and fucks asleep he can't break free
Mouth game like rap a lot on the Facebook say
Aimed at this rap a lot online surfing for the beach
Boys to bring the sand under her feet
She his rock bottom now ain't no need for retreat
Lord this man be half a man without her true call
Don't turn your back when she on that track
Watch out for that train wreck
Cause when she come you better watch your back
Watch out she's a train wreck",rap
"

Verse 1
She moves like a machine gun, ain't nothin' stoppin' her
Ain't no stoppin' the train from rushin' to next town
She got that sassy, classy, bad assy kind of style
Got the keys to the streets and she don't need no trial
Got her hair up in the air, her face glowing like gold
I'ma take her all around the world and never get too old

Chorus:
Don't turn your back when she's on that track 
Watch out for that train wreck
Cause when she come, you better watch your back
Watch out, she's a train wreck

Verse 2
She got lip gloss makin' it drip, putin' it down on the floor
Never seen nothin' like her before, gotta show her the door
Gonna pick her up and let her drop and let the bass like it should
Everyone gonna move their feet when she's in the hood
Up in the club she spinnin' like a record, when I see her I'm like ""Wow!""
Gonna get her on the dance floor and make sure she don't fall out

Chorus

Verse 3
She got a fire in her eyes, and she moves like a flame
She keeps me on my toes, and she never plays the same
Got a heart like a rock and a flow like a river
My life has never been this sweet, don't even need no sugar
I'ma take her on the road, gettin' ready to go
Gonna take her to the sky, and never let her go

Verse 1
I'm at the top of my game, no more playing games 
Kicking back, puffing on my dank, mary jane my thing
Getting lifted off this gin, passing it around with my friends
Tapping into my zen, smoke out everywhere I'm in 
I'ma hit my blunt, like a fat kid eating lunch
Feeling the vibe, getting so high I can't control my buzz
Blowing big clouds of smoke, all I need is just a little toke 
Feeling like I'm in the clouds and I can't come down

Chorus
Just smoke and blaze with me, I like marijuana 
You like marijuana, we like marijuana 
Legalize marijuana, just smoke 
Sparking up the Mary Jane, everyday in my own zone
Gettin' blowed, holding down the place
Cuz when I'm chief I never stay in one space

Verse 2
My brain is swole, and I'm in control
Rolling up loud, filling the room with the loudest smoke
Getting faded with my homies, enjoyin' hella tokes
Ain't no worries, keeping me so content when I'm puffing
Sometimes I'm sober, but lately I've been smokin'
Big spliffs and cigars, the way they make me smoke is like a voodoo
Can't nobody move me when I'm feeling too good
Taking a toke and getting so lifted, I'm in my own bubble

Chorus
Just smoke and blaze with me, I like marijuana 
You like marijuana, we like marijuana 
Legalize marijuana, just smoke 
Sparking up the Mary Jane, everyday in my own zone
Gettin' blowed, holding down the place
Cuz when I'm chief I never stay in one space

Verse 3
Puff, puff, pass it around, let's get the party lit
Lighting up the night, big hits make us all feel alright
I'm rolling up the green, getting hella high in between
Smoking with my homies, it's the marijuana that we need
Getting lifted off this smog, day by day it takes me higher 
We blowin up the trees, always chillin like it's nothing to see
Smoke it how you want, I just need to keep it lit 
Feeling like there's never an end, just blaze it and never quit

Chorus
Just smoke and blaze with me, I like marijuana

Verse 1
I roll and I rock, slanging Mary Jane to the sky
Never stop smokin' blunts and never pass one by
Puffin' on that strong stuff, the chronic might knock me
Wind blowing with me in the zone, no need to stop me
Pull up to the spot and there ain't no need to hide
Ain't no better time than now, so let's get twisted up tonight
High in the clouds, smoke rising to the sky
Don't damn the man, just hit the spliff and live your life

Let's smoke and blow, a blunt with me
I like marijuana, you like marijuana, we like marijuana, legalize marijuana

White and brown, smell it in the atmosphere
A bright light in the night, nothing left to fear
No more paranoia, no more anxiety
Just me and my homies, enjoying life and passing the tree
Bigger than your eye can see, this Mary Jane so fine
Elevate my level, straight up in the clouds and out of my mind
With the chronic stuff, nothing can stand in my way
Hit the blunt and hit the club, let's keep it lit like the 4th of July

Sky's numb, feeling relaxed and in control
No more anger, no more hate, just here to blow on souls
Give and take, my crew is right there by my side
Light that fire, let's pass it around and stay alive
Smoke in the air, nothing can't take away my peace
This Mary Jane got me feeling like I'm in the clouds and in my dreams
Feeling high, the Herb got me feelin' like I'm winning
Puffing on the tree, everything's better and I'm grinning

Verse 1
It's a cycle of pain, a lifetime of strive
Ain't no way around it, till ya learn to survive
Caught in a web, need nothin but a plan
To rise up and fight, while they don't understand
Ignorance fills the air, and an evil inside
The hatred too strong, like a looming tide
They wanna' keep us down, but we'll break the chains
With courage and faith, it's no game to play

How many times must you try, must you fail
Freedom is a state of mind transcended through hell
Give it up, walk away, you cannot conform
Be a slave to the grind, break free before you are born

Verse 2
Shackles and chains, hang from the battlements
A hundred lives wasted, for each question we ask
They wanna' control us, deny our truth
But we stand together, we can't be subdued
We know the truth, so we stand our ground
Don't let them take away, whatevers been found
We'll fight for the future and what it should be
And challenge the lies, that they want us to see

Chorus
How many times must you try, must you fail
Freedom is a state of mind transcended through hell
Give it up, walk away, you cannot conform
Be a slave to the grind, break free before you are born

Verse 3
It's time to rise up, and reclaim our place
It's time to fight on, and show they they can't erase
Our destinies written, in the hearts of us all
No more fear and hate, and no more to fall
So take this spirit, and spread it around
It's time for us to fight, for the future we found
Our freedom awaits us, so therefore we all must
Be brave, be kind, and provide us with trust.

How many times must you try, must you fail
Freedom is a state of mind transcended through hell
Give it up, walk away, you cannot conform

Not stopping, gonna keep going until there's not a single soul around.

Came up from the dirt, no one gave me nothin,
Had to fight for every breath, but still I kept on pushing,
Spittin my truth, never gonna stop, no matter what is thrown at me,
Gonna keep going, keep pushing, keep doing, never gonna quit no matter what comes at me.

Verse 1: 
I'm on a mission tryna find the zone,
Where nobody's ever trod before,
Never seen it up close or its known,
In my heart I want more,
Gonna search and explore,
Gonna make it to the top of the floor,
Gonna make it mine forevermore,
Catch me stepping to the next level cause im never stopping,
Gonna go where nobody has ever gone,
Gonna make it happen so come along,
Gonna take a journey cause im never lost,
Gonna get it done no matter the cost,

Gonna fly away,
Head up in the sky, 
High above the clouds,
Leave it all behind,
Gonna take a ride,
On a shooting star,
Imma touch the sky and blaze a trail real far,
Gonna chase my dreams and make them come alive, 
Gonna break through barriers and never compromise,
Gonna blaze my own path and show the world who I am,
Gonna set the record higher than anyone can,
Gonna take the lead and be first to stand,

Chorus: 
Tshawe I wanna go where nobody's gone before,

Gonna take a risk and never go back,
Gonna take the plunge and be on track,

Gonna be the one to break the mold and make history,
Gonna make it happen and set the tone, 
Gonna be the first to reach the unknown,

My style's too powerful to ignore
Gonna make the brothers and sisters unite, and boost the morale

Feeling like I'm starting, want to hit the top of the hill,
Got that aplomb and I'm never gonna get chill,

Gonna jump the hurdle, go and make it happen,
Gonna stay humble, doing what I can,
No looking back, got that fire in my soul,
Gonna take this movement to the top, it's my goal,

Met a hustler on the street, it was his time to shine,
Told me, ""Son, you don't have to worry, you can always dine,""
Heeled me up, told me never give up,
Gonna soar high, that's a fact, so never give up,

Get on the tracks and stay true to the game,
Gonna make a name, gonna take this fame,
Gonna take this music to the top of the hill,
Gonna stay humble and I'm never gonna be still,

My soul is wild, that's my personality shiver,
Gonna make a move, ain't gonna stand in the same spot,
Gonna take this game to the next level, no stop.",rap

With my weapons in my hand, I'm ready to sing
Ya'll better watch me now, I'm the man in this town

Run around the world like a diplomat
Tell them what they need to know, make sure they don't forget
Ya'll better make way cuz I'm not done yet

Look at the intensity, you thinking I'mma cut you when you see me mean muggin' and screaming at the muscle.

But I had to keep pushing, never letting haters deter my hustle
Real recognize real, gotta keep it on the level
My bars is like poison, had to learn to dodge the devils

With no regard for the ones trying to put out my flame
Broke through the glass ceilings, now I can call my own name
Not bound by the rules, no one can break my chains
My moves and my rhymes like a slick assassin

Can't catch me, I'm riding on the beat with no brakes
I'm coming heavy like Mike Tyson in his prime and I'm never late
I'm holding it down like a soldier while I'm rhyming in the rain
My flow's so strong, I'm making the crown bow like a king

Everything I heard was so incredible
But it's something I can hardly believe
So I look at my homies and ask them this question
Yo, how that gal got away so easily?

Chorus
She vanished in thin air, but before she disappeared 
Dropped the money bag on the floor, so it's crystal clear
How could she slip away with all the evidence around?
So we shook our heads in confusion when we heard the sound

Verse
Searching the scene you can almost hear the whispers
The mystery of cold cash that can't be found
From the gutter to the street they all know the story
She vanished in thin air with a hundred grand

Lookin' back to when we heard the tale of her escape
It was a tale of a lady and a crime so great
She had a partner in crime, one Clive Campbell from the Bronx
Took the money and ran, making us all so confused

We tried to track her down, follow the clues
But it seemed she had vanished off the face of the earth
And so the search went on, night and day
We felt helpless, but we kept looking anyway

Chorus
She vanished in thin air, but before she disappeared 
Dropped the money bag on the floor, so it's crystal clear
How could she slip away with all the evidence around?
So we shook our heads in confusion when we heard the sound

Verse
We had no luck, so we resorted to the hood
Hit the block and asked some questions, we heard the word was good
They said she had a plan to come back alive
But they would only help if we felt the vibe

So we followed their directions, down the back alleys and dark streets
'Til we found the place they spoke of, a rundown shack in the skreets
She was there, safe and sound, sporting a big smile
And greeted us with a laugh and a nod after awhile

Chorus
She vanished in thin air, but before she disappeared 
Dropped the money bag on the floor, so it's crystal clear
How could she slip away with all the evidence around?
So we shook our heads in confusion when we heard the sound

Outro 
We were amazed by the way she had out-thought the cops
And amazed by the way she had out-witted the robbers
We thanked her for not giving up and showed our respect
And we all shook our heads in confusion at the same time.",rap

Verse 1 
Look here see, I seen this bebop gal 
She had two faces, no you couldn't tell 
Ran her mouth so much it cost her the bell 
Death by strangulation, microphone cord and all 
Aimless in her agenda, she got away with two hundred thousand 
What a scandal, these two fighting over who was the star 
Golden legs made off with all the dough 
Saw it in the paper, Joe the Butcher said that's all it took 

Chorus 
But before ya know it, she's on the lam 
Time to call it a night, all this talk of the mysterious dame 
Thought I saw her out of the corner of my eye 
Hate to spoil the party, what are you boys having? 

Verse 2 
But in comes Fickle Face, time to make a break 
The devil has us by the throat, conspiracy won't work without a trace 
Eric B ain't President, but I got soul, trying to hide it 
Killed a man in Cypress, One-Eyed Charlie said we did it doggy-style 
So we jumped in my ride, twisted off a cap and opened her mouth wide 
Swallowed it whole and drank like a fish, but I wanted the truth 
So I pulled the revolver, sat her on the couch, and said it's gettin late 

Chorus 
But before you know it, she's on the lam 
Time to call it a night, all this talk of the mysterious dame 
Thought I saw her out of the corner of my eye 
Hate to spoil the party, what are you boys having? 

Verse 3 
Walk this way and she'll tell a children's story 
She said it was Bill Gates, she was born before the slave times days 
When the slaves said rhymes, and fell in love with Clive from Sedgwick Avenue 
Kool Herc, what do ya say? Yeah yeah yeah 
So she drops the money bag on the floor and fades 
If you really love me, she said, I'll come back alive 
Then I knew the truth, this gal was no ordinary jive 
All this talk of the mysterious dame and the party's over 
Time to call it a night, this rap was no bluff and the mystery's solved!",rap

Verse 2
I'ma do it like they never seen it before
Make 'em jealous, they ain't touchin me, like a locked door
My lyrics are smooth, like a supersoaker
Got the swag, like I ain't no undertaker

Got the knowledge for the code, so I can make it sang
From the hood to the Hills, y'all best believe
That I'ma put them nerds on the map, no DVR

Verse 3
My life is a journey and the path is my own
Using technology, tryin to find my own home
I'm in this game, you better write it down
Cause I'ma put the nerds in the front and the bullies in the backround
My rhymes are off the chain, so hot it need a fire extinguisher
My knowledge is so deep, it's like a hidden figure
Got the skills to crush and make this game mine
So gather round and listen, 'cause I'm bout to make a fool out of ya

Chorus
Get my geek on, get my get my geek on

Get my geek on, get my get my geek on

" where blue rag and black flag make the town swell with fools and they can t get away they get chased down and stomped out like a centipede 

Ain't no coward when I step to the block
Cuz I represent Crip and I ain't gon' stop
Flowin' with a tec nine cuz I'm a real nina
Bangin' in this hood, as a crab nigga, I'm a sinner
Hit the ratchet and let it blow and aim for the top
When I'm rollin then you know it's time to drop
Shotting through the sky, I'ma bring the pain
My homie to the left, Sin Loc, bring the flame
Gotta keep the peace, or it's the end of the day
No more crab killers, y'all aint gettin' away
Ridin' with a gat, tryna make it out the hood
Lookin' for these snoops, tryna take 'em out for good
My crew from east side, bout it all night
Put a slug in 'em, show 'em what it's like
When I'm finished, I'mma be the winner
Crispy and crispy, no more crab niggas in the diner
Rollin' with the C, better recognize the flow
Killin' all the gangstas, gotta let em know
What it's like, when I'm outta control
Snatchin' up the slob, layin' him down in a hole
I'm the Crip killer, y'all can see the proof
I'm tatted up, it's the truth
When I come through the hood, it's a massacre

What were you thinking when the night was deep and dark
Did you think of us, our lives and your mark
Infecting our minds with a plan so profound
Your intentions are clear, you're trying to take us down

Did you care about the lives that you stole away
Did you think about the children and the tears they had to pay
Terrifying is your scheme, it's like Russian Roulette
You're playing with fate, will it end our days

You leave us all behind, shattered and broken hearts
The naive leading the naive, have it your way
You've left us all behind, poisoned by deception
Fill us with lies and send us away, have it your way

Was it for your father, when the pain was so intense
Did you act the hero, the man with common sense
The world is crashing down, can't you hear it fall
You're so selfish and proud, what have you done to us all

Pledge your allegiance to the bombs bullets and blood
We can no longer trust, will we ever be heard
Can't rely on you, never again will we trust
Pledge your allegiance to the bombs bullets and blood, have it your way

I'm gonna take it to the streets and speak of what I see
But nobody listens to a word of what I preach
Truth or fiction my visions aint no illusion
Ain't no time to hesitate, so I'm gonna run on through

A lie they told you was all they gave you, to keep you in chains
You had the power to break away but you chose to stay
Till you were underneath their thumb and feeling overwhelmed
Until you heard a voice in the wind saying, ""You can be free""

Have it your way, no more false lies in your head
Have it your way, and no more lies to be said
You're free to make your own decisions, so don't be misled
Have it your way, no more control over you

You thought you had control, but you were playing with fire
Till you were standing in the flames and burning in the wire
All you could do was concentrate, then you could see the light
It's a new found way, breaking out the chains and feeling alright

Have it your way, no more false lies in your head
Have it your way, and no more lies to be said
You're free to make your own decisions, so don't be misled
Have it your way, no more control over you

Your reign is over and you've got the power to break through
Gonna live your life like it's never been lived before
Cause you know freedom ain't a place or just a thought or a feeling
So take the wheel and never look back, start to make it real

Have it your way, no more false lies in your head
Have it your way, and no more lies to be said
You're free to make your own decisions, so don't be misled
Have it your way, no more control over you",rap

Verse 1
Look at how she moves, look at how she groove
Doin her dance in her dress, she always look so smooth
My heart racing, tryna find the words to speak
Wanna tell her how I feel, but my brain is weak
Look in her eyes and all I can say is damn
Just wanna be her king, and take her by the hand
Take her to the stars, the moon, and all around the globe
Just wanna show her love and shower her with loads

Chorus
I'll be there for you babe, I'll be the one you need
I'll be the man that will love you, I'll be there for you babe

Verse 2
She got the body of a goddess, curves that make me melt
She's the queen of my heart, no one else can compare
Don't wanna be her man, but the thought of it is nice
I fantasize about her, thinkin of paradise
She's somebody I can't forget, and she's my one desire
Just wanna feel the love, get with her and have a fire
Time stands still when she's around, and my heart skips a beat
Just wanna keep her close, and make sure she's always safe and sound

Chorus
I'll be there for you babe, I'll be the one you need
I'll be the man that will love you, I'll be there for you babe

Verse 3
Tryin to find the courage to tell her how I feel
Ain't never been in love, so I'm afraid of the real
But I know I got to risk it all, if I wanna be free
Gotta tell her how I feel, and show her what she means to me
Got a lot at stake, a promise to make
And a kiss from her lips, could seal it all and make it real
One day I'm gonna tell her all the truth I'm thinking
And I hope she'll take a chance, and we can start something",rap
"

Verse 1 
Look at how she move, look at how she sway
Yeah she is a godess when she walk in the bay
She's wearing the finest and moving with grace 
Everything she does, turn heads in the place 
Got a style all her own and a tatoo on her arm 
No-one can resist and their feeling is strong 
Go hard in the gym, she's not the average joe 
She's born to win and she knows the flow

Chorus 
I'll be there for you babe, I'll be the one that you need 
I'll be the man that will love you, I'll be there for you babe 

Verse 2 
She's got a heart of gold and a positive vibe 
Her aura's so strong it's contagious, it lights up the night

She don't care 'bout the money, and she's gonna break all the rules 
She always pushing boundaries, forward motion and never a fool 

Living in the moment, she's gonna make her dreams come true
Nothing gonna stop her, she's fearless, what she is gonna do

Chorus 
I'll be there for you babe, I'll be the one that you need 
I'll be the man that will love you, I'll be there for you babe 

Verse 3 
She's got a glow that radiates, and a fire in her soul 
She's beat the odds she's overcome and achieving her goals 
She's never let the past define her, she's wise enough to know 
What the future holds, only she can show

She's wild and free and living life to the fullest 
Staying strong, never gonna surrender or let nobody pull her

Verse 1
Walking through the streets like a soldier of war,
I got my gat close, cause I know what's in store
Not a soul around, there's no one in sight
I'm watching my back, about to start the fight
My nine Taurus loaded up, get ready to start
Knowing that I'm coming with a heavy heart
My team ready to roll, so I spit the flow
Ain't no turning back, watch it all unfold

We rep the QBC, you best rep yours
Money, bars, and guns, that's what we live for
Milli Stacks ready to be guarded by hollow tip slugs

There's no hesitation, I'm coming for blood and ground
Sign my roster, and know we'll never finish
Infinite moves, so this rap game keep on spinning

I got your back, so no need to be scared
My mind control is tight, so better beware
Shape and mold your son, and I'm gonna hold him

Playa hatin' me, just makin' me stronger
Concentrate on that cheddar, no time for longer
Better dead her, you know the routine
It's a small world, and niggas talkin' like bitches

Vegas high rollers, livin' past my means
My actions speak louder than my empty words
I'm not here to apologize, no empathy
Don't drag yourself through the mud and expect me to take the pity
The consequences of my actions ain't gonna disappear
They just keep coming, didn't think that the money I spent was queer
Thought I'd get away with it, just like my last stunt
But when they saw my actions they knew that I was done

Actions speak louder than words do
Don't even think 'bout what you gonna say
My patience's wearing thin, no more games to play
This ain't gonna change, cause I'm here to stay

Can't forget how much I make mistakes
I can hear the sound of my own voice shaking
But still I gotta keep steppin' in the same direction
Forget my lies, I just need to show my true reflection

Actions speak louder than words do
Don't even think 'bout what you gonna say
My patience's wearing thin, no more games to play
This ain't gonna change, cause I'm here to stay

Actions speak louder, so I ain't gonna make a sound
No more of the same, I'm changing my compound
Can't rely on words when I'm trying to make a change
Only thing left to do is just walk the talk and that remains

Actions speak louder than words do
Don't even think 'bout what you gonna say
My patience's wearing thin, no more games to play
This ain't gonna change, cause I'm here to stay",rap
"

Every time I hear you talk it's like your mouthing off
Somehow you think that doesn't matter and I shouldn't scoff
But your actions only talk louder and they've been talking 'bout you
You seem to think that you can hide your feelings, but that won't do

You say you've changed and you want a second chance
But I just can't trust the words coming outta your mouth
Cause your actions showed me something else, what it's all about
Your sincerity is questionable, and that's something that's hard to swallow

Actions speak louder than words, so don't tell me what you think
Cause if your words don't match the actions then I know it's gonna sink
I'm standing in the wings, observing the show
Don't be surprised when I say I don't believe in the words you flow

I'm watching listening, the volume's always the same
Actions speak louder so better think before you claim
If you want to prove that you're genuine and I should trust
Then you better show me more than just talking, you gotta act and adjust

Actions speak louder than words do, I don't want to hear no lies
I need to see your actions to know what's really on your mind
Don't tell me how you feel, just man up and show me how
Actions speak louder than your words, so what will you do now?",rap

Verse 1
I seen the devil when I was at the night club
She cut the line, made her way and show'd the love
The devil was a pretty little thing, look she so right
Staring down, she had them lights in her eyes
Sexy little missy with a style so sweet
Taller than she seems, lookin' fine like she built to speak
Beautiful dark eyes, with a voice so bold
Soft hands, real moves, and the body so cold

Chorus
I will be here through thick and thin
Hold on to all that try to win
And I will be your guiding light, breaking through the night
Modern man must hustle, stay in the fight

Verse 2
Don't listen to what Jane says, don't wanna hear that same spiel
Rather turn off the radio, and listen to the rain wheel
Little sister needs some seclusion, but it's hidden in the noise
In the pop music, she's searching for a healing noise
She's used to falling, but you don't see her following
Riding that outer ring to find her own Saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the gray matter
Little baby doll, still don't know what to say

Chorus
I will be here through thick and thin
Hold on to all that try to win
And I will be your guiding light, breaking through the night
Modern man must hustle, stay in the fight

Verse 3
Hush little lady don't tell a soul
Cuz others they won't understand what they don't know
The patience is short, and the pride too tall
Break it all and smash the past like it's made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lose her dream
Had the pleasure of seeing the hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
Put my arms around her and take her around town

Chorus
I will be here through thick and thin
Hold on to all that try to win
And I will be your guiding light, breaking through the night
Modern man must hustle, stay in the fight",rap

Verse 1
My first run-in with the devil was a sight to behold
She left Lucifer's heaven to come and hang with the souls
Small stature, but her presence was large
My 5’5” goddess with curves that were hard to disregard
Dark eyes invited me in, she looked into my core
Large lips, soft hands and hair that cascaded to the floor
I said I'd make her smile, it was a simple task
A smile on her face, it was all that I asked
Chorus
I'll show you all that you need to know
Hold on to anyone that's loved you, and I'll love you through the struggle and the simple show
Girl, you got to understand, the modern man must hustle
People talk, but who cares, it's the same old spiel
Verse 2
Let's break the radio, I wanna hear the rain pour
My little sis needs a place to call her own
Through the rhythm of the pop music, she'd find stability to explore
She's used to the feeling of constantly falling, never following
But bouncing between healing and hollering, on a ride around her Saturn
Thoughts scattered all across her gray matter, her doll-like face displays no chatter
Patience is strong, pride too tall, but it's time to break it all
Smash the past like it was made of glass, no other way it'll ever last
Chorus
I'll show you all that you need to know
Hold on to anyone that's loved you, and I'll love you through the struggle and the simple show
Girl, you got to understand, the modern man must hustle
People talk, but who cares, it's the same old spiel
Verse 3
It hurts to see Lucy lose a dream, I've been granted the pleasure of witnessing her kick and scream
As she settles down I'll turn the sound down and wrap my arms round her
Lost and found like a prized possession, I'll make it my mission to protect her
Hush little lady don't say a word, or else the village will know you're disturbed
Once they know you're vulnerable they won't stop till they open you slow
I'm a chapter in your textbook, read me like a checkbook
Never mistook love at first sight for a sex look, I'm here for the good stuff
Feed me your troubles, there's no need to cuddle, wrap up in my mitten and coat
And when the snow falls, I'll keep your winter afloat
Chorus
I'll show you all that you need to know
Hold on to anyone that's loved you, and I'll love you through the struggle and the simple show
Girl, you got to understand, the modern man must hustle
People talk, but who cares, it's the same old spiel",rap

Ain't nobody can tell me nothing, ain't nobody can stop me soon

I'm making moves with the G's no fear in my eyes
No matter what they say I'm grinding just to get by
Hit the strip club cash in my hand, I'm ready to shine
Yall can't mess with the team cause we all just fine

I'm in the studio all night, pens to the pad
Just to stay ahead of the pack, never falling back
Took the crown with no doubt, extra shots in my route
But don't be fooled by the fame, I still stack with the same crew

I'm hitting the road with my team, bout to rep for the town
Came a long way from nothing, no way for us to turn round
Riding in the Jags or the Benz, I'm tuned to the sound
Money never sleeps, no stops until I'm running this town

Breaking down my walls before I'm going too deep 
I'm trying to stay away, it's not what I need 
I'm putting up my guard so I don't get too weak 
Cause I can't bear to get hurt and make my heart bleed

When I start to feel something I try to back away 
I'm trying to be strong, I'm determined not to cave 
I'm so scared of falling, I can't take the chance 
And I ain't gonna mess around, no second glance

You and I make so much love, why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah you got me holding back, holding back, but it ain't enough
You and I make so much love, why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah you got me holding back, holding back, cause it ain't enough

Reality's hitting me, I got my heart on the line
I don't want to be fooled, it's always been a crime
You got me thinking too much, you know I'm drowning in doubt
No one knows what I'm going through, I'm living in a drought

Every time we touch, I get so close to you
But my demons keep talking, what am I supposed to do?
I'm so tired of being scared and I just can't take it 
It's time to break down these rules and let my heart break it

Chorus:
You and I make so much love, why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah you got me holding back, holding back, but it ain't enough
You and I make so much love, why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah you got me holding back, holding back, cause it ain't enough

Bridge:
I'm at a crossroads, I gotta make the right choice
I'm too scared to fall and use my voice
I thought I was strong, but I'm not that brave
Will I break down my walls, or stay in my cage?

Chorus:
You and I make so much love, why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah you got me holding back, holding back, but it ain't enough
You and I make so much love, why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah you got me holding back, holding back, cause it ain't enough 
You and I make so much love, love 
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love

Censor censor realize censor censor no friend of mine
You bought the same old trip so innocent you're out of reach

Let it be known I'm in control of what's mine
Told myself time and time again I won't decline
Loneliness a subject that I'm to familiar with
Letting go of what I used to know no way I can switch
My ambitions too strong too high to maintain
Every decision always leads me back to the same refrain
Censor, censor realise, censor, censor, no friend of mine
You bought the same old trip so innocent you're out of reach
Nothing can dilute the love, no law can ever speak
I can't deny the feeling of taking back what's mine
Censor, censor, realise, censor, censor, no friend of mine

Day by day I see the world through a different light
As I search for new possibilities in life
It's the same old cycle and I'm stuck in the same loop
Though I'm going forward I'm still feeling out of the groove
Maybe the answer lies in finding a way to let go
But no matter what I learned I'll never get back what I don't know

Verse 1
Started as broken pieces, hearts so full of deceit
I'm searching for a way to heal and set us free
The call of the wild pulls us together, but love's not an easy thing
So I'm staring at these walls again, trying to dream a dream

Chorus
When will you realize now you're forever mine?
You don't have to run, I won't compromise
All that I know is right, you and I are one

Verse 2
Sometimes I feel like a fool, I'm running out of time
I'm searching for the answer, can I break this line?
So I'm wondering why you'd choose to leave, and change the way things were
Will I ever fall in love again, or will I forever hurt?

Chorus
When will you realize now you're forever mine?
You don't have to run, I won't compromise
All that I know is right, you and I are one

Verse 3
The road ahead is puzzling, my heart is full of fear
My passion's like a fire burning, I'm so close yet so far
And I can feel my spirit rising, it's time to take a stand
I'll keep searching for the strength, to win the fight for love

Chorus
When will you realize now you're forever mine?
You don't have to run, I won't compromise

Verse 1
I drive around your 'hood with my heart hopin' that you'd show
But I know you ain't too keen on bein' seen with me no more
The thought of you not returning my calls hurts me deep inside
But my love for you ain't gonna just up and die

Chorus
I'm sittin' here lookin' at these photos in my head
Can't you see that you and me are meant to be together instead?
Don't run away, give in to me, I've made up my mind
We will be one, so don't you hide, forever you're mine

Verse 2
I'm feeling down and out, like a fool, so confused
Did I do something wrong, why'd you just up and leave?
No conversations, no more late night calls, saw your number change
Baby, when you think of me, do you feel any pain?

Chorus
I'm sittin' here lookin' at these photos in my head
Can't you see that you and me are meant to be together instead?
Don't run away, give in to me, I've made up my mind

Verse 3
Maybe one day I'll find you, show you what you mean to me
And remind you that I love you, and everything that we could be
My heart will never rest until you come back home
So don't ignore me, baby, you'll never be alone

Chorus
I'm sittin' here lookin' at these photos in my head

Feel a sharp pain every time I see her face
But nothing else can take me to that special place
Cuz life is too short and I just can't run in place
She's out of reach and I'm feeling so out of place

Chorus:
I fuckin hate her to death, I fuckin hate her to death
She's incredible, unforgettable, undeniable, breathtaking
I'm furious, she's so mysterious, I'm curious, earthshaking
She's always right and every time she gives me sight though I'm blind
She's always saving my life but she don't belong to me
She tells me things are alright but she don't belong to me
I try to follow her light but she don't belong to me
I feel her venomous bite cause she don't belong to me

Verse 2:
She's shinin, she's smilin, she's always tryin
But I'm stuck here just cryin, when my heart is dyin
I let go of my pride, I just can't hide
My love for her is strong, I'm never done wrong
She's the missing piece to my heart and soul
But I'm stuck here all alone, while I'm losin control
I can feel her in my dreams, but still I'm losin steam
I'm missing her kisses, her hugs, her giggles, her laughs
But she don't belong to me, and that's a fact

Chorus
I fuckin' hate her to death

No matter how much I tried, I can no longer believe

But no one can deny, how much I've been through
Still I can't let go, all these feelings for you

Chorus
I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you
I breathe you, I taste you, I can't live without you
I just can't take any more, this life of solitude
I guess I'm out the door, and now I'm done with you

Verse 3
I see the blood all over your hands, does it make you feel more like a man
Was it all just a part of your plan, the pistol's shaking in my hands
And all I can hear is the sound
Of the end of what we had found

Chorus
I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you
I breathe you, I taste you, I can't live without you
I just can't take any more, this life of solitude
I guess I'm out the door, and now I'm done with you

Verse 1
Said I won't be fooled again, but here I am, caught in your world of sin
Ain't no way of gettin out this game, tryin to make up for all the pain
Every time I think of you my heart aches, so I just keep myself awake
Starin out my window with a million miles between us, hopin you'll come back soon

Chorus
Always, always, always, always, always, always
I just can't live without you, I love you, I hate you
I can't get around you, I breathe you, I taste you
I can't live without you, I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude, I guess I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you, I love you, I hate you
I can't live without you

Verse 2
So much for all I thought I know, I tremble, my heart refused to show
The kind of emotion that I feel deep inside, tryin hard to bury all my pride
I wanna take back all the words, all the times, every time I said goodbye
It's like I'm never gonna break through your walls and I'm always outta time

Chorus
Always, always, always, always, always, always
I just can't live without you, I love you, I hate you
I can't get around you, I breathe you, I taste you
I can't live without you, I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude, I guess I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you, I love you, I hate you
I can't live without you

Verse 3
So I'm lettin go of all this pain, I'm movin on and bid farewell
Eager to make a brand new start, I'm hopin I can heal my heart
But I still hear you whisperin in my head, like a ghost that won't go away
Oh, how I wish that I could just forget, and break free of this pain like yesterday

Chorus
Always, always, always, always, always, always
I just can't live without you, I love you, I hate you
I can't get around you, I breathe you, I taste you
I can't live without you, I just can't take anymore
This life of solitude, I guess I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you, I love you, I hate you
I can't live without you",rap

I'm done trying to fit someone else's image,
Can't take it no more cuz that ain't who I am,
I'm done acting like the life I'm living isn't real,
Every decision I make is a testament to how I feel.

Oh yeah I know what I'm not,
I'm done being somebody else, shut the door and lock it tight,
Craving a life where I don't have to hide,
Living my real life is a feeling that I can't deny.

I been searching for a light, a place that I can call my own,
Searching for an answer that can't be found in someone else's home,
Been trying to survive and make it through these days,
The truth is I'm the only one who can lead me to the way.

Yeah I know what I'm not,
I'm done being somebody else, shut the door and lock it tight,
Craving a life where I don't have to hide,
Living my real life is a feeling that I can't deny.

From here I'll take the reins, take a stand, no more second guessing,
Break the chains of all the lies, fulfill the truth that I'm confessing,
I can't see, but I know I'm on the right path,
No way I'ma stop, this is the only way I'm gonna last.

Lookin in the mirror, I ask myself,
Who is the one I'm seeing, what have I become?
I've gotta stand up for the things that I believe
My father taught me that, made it quite clear to me.

This is my life, my choice to make
These people just don't get it, they want me to be something fake
I won't bother with trying too hard,
Cause I'm done with putting on a facade.

Chorus:
I've been wondering and wondering,
Trying to find a home
To these questions I'm asking, I want to know
I know what I'm not
 Keep searching and don't stop
Cause I know, yes I know, what I'm not

Change the world, don't hide,
Don't accept what's wrong, don't just fly away and hide.
Put your worries on a plane and send them far out of sight,
Take all your sorrows, put 'em overboard and out of sight.

You can make your own way, find your own path,
Stop and look around you, don't get stuck in the past,
Creative's not just in your head, even if it's hard to see,
The beauty of life will always set you free.

Feeling all the stress and strain, never knew how to stay
On the right path of life until you came, and held me tight
Showed me all I need to know, and put me in the light

Now I'm breathing for the first time and I'm leaving all this behind

Ain't no sorry for the things I've done, I know I can't go back
But I'm willing to make it up to you, willing to fight and attack

And I will stand for what I know is real, no matter the sore

Though it won't erase the foolish things I've done, can't delete my misguided past
But now I'm seeing clearly, no more blind way to last
I can see the writings on the wall, I'm so glad I didn't fall
Time's slowly crawling away and I am thankful it all

"

[Verse 1]
Rise up now and take your place, we'll rise above this game of chase
It's time to seek out our own fate, so keep movin' at a steady pace
We free our minds, no one can stop us now, the sky is our limit, we'll take a bow
Let's keep it real, no need to pretend, and no one can take away our wings again

[Chorus]
Flying crow fly alone, a careless soul that sings,
For everyone when the world closes, a steady blade tears the seal
A fallen angel selling secrets we can steal, while brushing off the rust we'll go insane
A beaten dog in anguish counts his days, so come down with me, it's time to leave

[Verse 2]
From the depths of our hearts we'll be reborn, no more living in despair forlorn
We've broken through the silence, let's shout it out, a new horizon awaits us without a doubt
The bridge is here, we got a chance to fly, a chance to choose our own destiny
So let's go out and find our way, a road that no one can ever take away

[Chorus]
Flying crow fly alone, a careless soul that sings,
For everyone when the world closes, a steady blade tears the seal
A fallen angel selling secrets we can steal, while brushing off the rust we'll go insane
A beaten dog in anguish counts his days, so come down with me, it's time to leave

[Verse 3]
Our destination ahead, the unknown awaits, we'll never look back as it seals our fate
Pushin' through life's storms and boulders, we will strive, never stop comin' up with goals that we'll try
Our vision is clear, our wings take us to the sky, so take off and forever make destiny our ally

[Chorus]
Flying crow fly alone, a careless soul that sings,
For everyone when the world closes, a steady blade tears the seal
A fallen angel selling secrets we can steal, while brushing off the rust we'll go insane
A beaten dog in anguish counts his days, so come down with me, it's time to leave",rap
"

Verse 1
Eyes to the sky, I look and see,
A lonely crow that soars so free,
A heart so cold and a voice so loud,
When the world is shutting down, I'm still so proud.

Chorus 
Come down with me, it's time to leave,
Come down with me, and set us free,
We'll go insane, no one to blame,
For the fallen angel selling secrets we can steal.

Verse 2
Dust off the rust and dig deep within,
A beaten dog in his sufferin',
His days are few and his sorrows too,
But soon we'll stand and count the days, me and you.

Chorus 
Come down with me, it's time to leave,
Come down with me, and set us free,
We'll go insane, no one to blame,
For the fallen angel selling secrets we can steal.

Verse 3
Tears in the night and hearts that won't heal,
A world so cold and a fire so real,
The pain and the sorrow and the hate will rise,
But we can't give up, no matter the size.

Chorus 
Come down with me, it's time to leave,
Come down with me, and set us free,
We'll go insane, no one to blame,
For the fallen angel selling secrets we can steal.",rap

Verse 1:
I'm from the streets where the life is not sweet
Gotta work hard just to fill the plate with the things that you need
From the flip of a burger to dealing rock
Just trying to survive in this real world shock
And even when I was in high school
Life was no easy feat, no bills to pay but I had a roof over my head
Working part time at Ob's Birdstand
Just trying to make it, make it and make it in this land

Chorus:
You don't work, you don't eat
It's street life, gotta compete
You gotta hustle, gotta hustle, gotta hustle
You don't work, you can't eat

Verse 2:
From Washington High I graduated but wasn't with it
Kicked out the house when I was eighteen
No money for college, so I had to find my way
Tried the so-called right way, went to a J.C. but I wasn't getting paid
Working at the chicken stand, had to pay my rent
My job wasn't cutting it, now I'm drinking gin
Alternative to dig out of this pit
Either keep doing what I'm doing or buy a gat, yeah that's it

Chorus:
You don't work, you don't eat
It's street life, gotta compete
You gotta hustle, gotta hustle, gotta hustle
You don't work, you can't eat

Verse 3:
Gotta stay alive, gotta survive
Do or die, gotta eat, not a full time crook
But born right, so if I want to eat sometimes I got to jack
Pulling burgs at night, counting my funds three times a day
Drive a coupe out on Danas, bumping to the players
Say what you want but on these streets better work or you won't eat
So I'ma hustle, hustle and get my matters
Gotta focus on the park, watch how I freak this

Chorus:
You don't work, you don't eat
It's street life, gotta compete
You gotta hustle, gotta hustle, gotta hustle
You don't work, you can't eat",rap
 ayo you need to stay sharp and make sure your wheels don t spin when you re out on the grind cause it s a rat race for for sure out here in the streets ain t no time to hesitate just calculate and calculate it go hard and you can make it life s a bitch so make sure you don t trip keep a foot in the door and a fist on the grip you don t work you can t eat,rap

Verse 1
My chest feels like it's made of stone, my head still spins the same
The pressure builds up, with nowhere to go, I'm growing numb to the pain
The reality of what I'm going through, I deal with day to day
This struggle never goes away, why can't I get away?

Chorus
When will this all be over? How come this never ends?
This room keeps closing in on me, not much outside that I care to see
This pain could all be over if I just blinked an eye
Keep holding on to some star that stops me from washing the world away
Hey yeah, hey yeah, washing the world away, hey yeah, hey yeah, washing the world away

Verse 2
I find that no one understands me, I feel so all alone
Does anyone feel the way I do? This weight is hard to bear on my own
My days are getting longer, and I'm barely holding on
My future seems uncertain, can't seem to find a home

Chorus
When will this all be over? How come this never ends?
This room keeps closing in on me, not much outside that I care to see
This pain could all be over if I just blinked an eye
Keep holding on to some star that stops me from washing the world away
Hey yeah, hey yeah, washing the world away, hey yeah, hey yeah, washing the world away

So how can I get through today? Feelin' blind with only me to blame
Still I find I try to hide, maybe this time I'll find my way

My thoughts keep spinning round and round
It seems right here is where I'm bound
I lie awake and talk to the night
I make my wishes, feelin' so down
I'm so far away from you my love
No matter what I do or I think of
It's like a wall between us forever
I can't help when I'm feeling bereft

Chorus:
I know in my head what I feel in my heart
And I don't want to go on, want to give in
But my heart tells me no, show me how to begin
And there's no use pretending, what's there to say
I'm too much in love and you're too far away

Verse 2:
My mind's a war zone tryin' to cope
It's hard to find a way to cope
I'm stuck in this situation, nowhere to go
The pain I feel, I just can't let go
I reach out, but I can't find you
My life is your dark shade of blue
My soul cries out without a sound
I'm just hoping you will be around

Chorus:
I know in my head what I feel in my heart
And I don't want to go on, want to give in
But my heart tells me no, show me how to begin

Bridge:
I'm gettin' close to the edge, but promise me you'll stop me fallin'
And I've no right to make these demands, but each time you leave I feel I'm losin' you
Why does the voice in my head never speak to my heart?
I need you to love me, without you I can't survive, I'm barely alive

Chorus:
I know in my head what I feel in my heart

Verse 1 
I'm standing on the edge of an open field 
Facing the unknown surrounded by chill 
My heart is aching, missing you like hell 
I don't know how much more I can take, I can't compel 
My love for you is so strong, growing stronger still 
But every time you leave I just feel like I'm standing still 

Chorus 
Why does the voice in my head never speak to my heart 
I need you to love me without you I can't survive 
I'm barely alive, I'm barely alive 

Verse 2 
Wishing I could borrow your wings and fly away 
To some place where I could make you stay 
I'm determined to make this love forever stay 
Else I'll just be broken and never feel okay 
Cause every time you go away it's like the world fades away 
And all I'm left with is a broken heart and an empty dismay 

Chorus 
Why does the voice in my head never speak to my heart 
I need you to love me without you I can't survive 
I'm barely alive, I'm barely alive 

Verse 3 
I want to take your hand and keep you here with me 
You make my darkness into light, thats what you do to me 
Like a storm after the rain you keep me company 
To make sure that I am strong and the sun can still see me 
And even when the night is dark, I'll never let go 
Cause without your love I can't even breathe, no I can't let go

Why does the voice in my head never speak to my heart 
I need you to love me without you I can't survive

Verse 1:
I'm lost in this terrain is what I'll confess
Forsaken by the darkness and I can't regress
My life's been a living hell and I'm in distress
And I'm scared of the outcome, no matter success
Can I find a way out or have I reached the end
My prayers go unheard, I feel God has forsaken me
I'm stuck in this cycle, no way to defend
My life of despair, all I can do is pretend

Be prepared for hell and I say oh well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes and realize I've died
Be prepared for hell and I say oh well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes and realize I've died

Verse 2:
The cold of the night, the chill of the air
My mind is in ruins and I can't go anywhere
I'm stuck in this limbo and I'm full of despair
How will I ever move on when no one is there?
I'm searching for answers, no one can hear
The agony and pain, it's all I can feel
But in my darkest hour, I still hold on to the hope
That I can make it out alive, I ain't gonna give up on me

Be prepared for hell and I say oh well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes and realize I've died
Be prepared for hell and I say oh well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes and realize I've died

I'll take this pain and I'll use it as fuel
Gonna move on from this pain, I'm refusing to be a fool
My faith in God, it's what gives me strength
I'm gonna make it out alive, I'm gonna make it out at length
This struggle is hard, this life is a mess
But there's still a way out, I guess
I'm gonna face my demons, take on this test
Be prepared for hell and I'll survive this mess

Verse 1 
Time keep tickin on me my situation isn't sweet 
It would take a miracle for me to go back, I can't retreat
Everything I worked for crumbling, bumbling, and mumbling
I'm lost, With all the hustling and scamming, I can't go back to surviving 
Pressure, pressure, I'm feeling it all from the street
It's like I'm stuck in a nightmare and I can't get up on my feet
No matter how hard I try, I'm still falling behind
But I gotta keep hustling if I'm gonna survive

Chorus 
The heart of a tiger will commit homicide 
Dismantle any challenger or rival 
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive 
N'tma to police, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger 

Verse 2 
Police sirens on my street, I'm running faster than the wind
With all the drugs and the guns around, I'm livin' life on the edge
Tryna stay away from all the trouble, but it's like I'm in a rut
Gotta stay ahead and keep hustlin' if I'm gonna stay out of the cut
My homies keep talking about me, but I know what's best for me
If I don't stay focused, I'm gonna be another statistic in the street
You can always see me hustling, never giving up the fight
My eyes open wide, I'm looking for some light

Chorus 
The heart of a tiger will commit homicide 
Dismantle any challenger or rival 
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive 
N'tma to police, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger 

Verse 3 
I'm tryna find a way out of this rat race, livin' life like a game
Tryna make some money in the streets, but never doin' no wrong
I'm just a regular dude, livin' life on the street
Tryna make a livin' to survive in this concrete jungle, I gotta stay on my feet
Out on the street, I'm tryna find a way to get by
And stay focused on my dream when I got no one to reply
I'ma keep on walkin' and never stop until I make it out this mess 
And share my story with the world, so that no one ends up like me

Chorus 
The heart of a tiger will commit homicide 
Dismantle any challenger or rival 
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive 
N'tma to police, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger",rap

loud pipes and a grill straight outta Compton
six-five forties on the wheels, all chrome
day in the sun, with the cash that I own

stone cold street smarts, now I'm coastin

I know that the game ain't never been easy
and I put down the pen when it got too sleazy
move light, and handle biz,
never give up, play my cards, time it just right
flow like a river, neva stop
I'm in the hood, runnin' the block

doin about 30 in a fly ass whip
windows up, got it cloudy and s***
rollin up, another joint
shotgun a bad bitch, and all she wanna do is smoke
you and smoke weed, and got me feelin' like damn
I gotta be the man, I gotta be the man

I gotta be the man, I gotta be the man
she swear that I'm the man, got me feelin' like damn

all my niggas round me, we slippin' and slidin'
sippin' that kush, no hint of ridin'

got my open-eyed dawgs, keep it gritty
seen the posers come and go, the clock don't turn the same
stay grimey from the floor to the frame
so I'ma keep the fire burnin', spark the flame
hit the highway, with fifteen on the brain

Verse1:
I used to trust you and thought you were real,
But you were always missin' the deal.
Your words were so false, it felt like a crime,
The smoke and mirrors were runnin' me dry.

Chorus:
So fake that you hate it, a city that seems so jaded,
I can't, I can't end up like that.
It's all about what you drive, who you know,
In a second it'll swallow you whole and so fast just like that.

Verse 2:
You pride yourself on what you possess,
But all your money won't save you from stress.
When it's all gone, you'll be standin' alone,
Your lies and backstabbing you'll have to atone.

Chorus:
To all you who want to, to all you who need to,
You need to know I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me.
I finally had enough of what you say,
Now you're talkin' tough 'cause you backstabbed me.

Bridge:
It's funny how you lie and try to wreck me,
It's funny how you're fallin' on your face.
I'm never gonna let you disrespect me,
You're my derailment.

Chorus:
The train is off the tracks, I'm not lookin' back.
I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me.
I finally had enough of what you say,
Now you're talkin' tough 'cause you backstabbed me. (Repeat)

Outro:
Where do we go from here,
With everything so unclear?
Turned out to be, by far, my longest year.
It's too late to turn back time,

Verse 1:
It's Slim Thuggah Mothafuckin' Boss in this bizz,
Haters got nothin' to do with it, this ain't no miss,
Talk about money, you ain't got enough for the rent,
Hold up, wait, let me make this clear, I ain't bluffin',

Do it to yo face without question or a facial expression,
I'm putting work in to get to where I'm at,
Lil y'all niggas better keep yall damn mouth shut,
I'm sittin' on top of the game, like I'm a mountain,
I stay grinding while they slacking and still aint counting,
I'm tryna get to the top on my own,
I done been through the mud and the shit to get what I'm owed,
I'm doin' big thangs, I don't even need to boast,
Lil homie, don't step to me cuz I'ma let the fours roast,
It's Slim Thuggah and I'm runnin' the show,
Lil homie, you ain't even getting close,
I'm the truth, no need for lies,
So don't try to come around my side, cuz I'ma leave you behind.

Chorus:
Yeah Slim Thuggah, the Boss, it's official,
Niggas hating now and later,
Ass niggas get your money right, ha,
Listen nigga, show me ten 'G's and I'll show you a hundred,
All that shit you niggas dream about I've been there and done it,
Underground rap, I run it,
Ask the stores you sell to, ask they owner who they gotta give most of they mail to,
It's either me, Watts, or Colorchange runnin' the game,
Not no still in the game or bullshit street fame.

Verse 2:
My niggas seen Jay-Z and Nas, they start feeling theyselves,
Talking down on the boss, like they killing themselves,
Their wealth got lost, they shoulda kept their mouth closed,
Driving a Northstar, big ballin' and stomping on hoes,
Y'all haters just mad cuz I made it,
Can't get pre orders, my album's anticipated,
Every nigga I spoke on in all these songs,
I just put money in your pockets so just leave it alone,
Think about it every time y'all make me do these CD's,
I'm headed back to the bank to pick up a hundred G's,
Lil Yo, ask your sister how much cash I stack,
Whenever I hit the bank, she gotta go to the back,
And pick up mo big faces, Bridgette, you cool with me,
I just gotta wreck your brother for being cruel to me,
You say I hurt his feelings and I left him alone,
I got news your little brother tried to do Slim wrong,
See how God works, the real niggas succeed,
Why you haters make drank and weed?
Remember one thing, feel me, the truth hurts don't it,
Lil Yo shouldn't have fucked with me, punk ass boy, HA!

Verse 1:
Crawling in my own skin, no way out I'm livin'
My life has taken a turn, and it feels like I'm dyin'
Everyday I'm tryin' to fight, there's no end in sight
Troubles I'm feeling, buildin' and overwhelming
My heart it skips a beat, no way to change my bleak
The weight of this world so heavy, I can't even speak
I'm done trying, I'm done trying, the guilt is vicious
I'm searching for saving, I'm pleading for mercy

Chorus:
Can't you see that we are running out of time?
I am dying but I will not die
Somebody save me from myself, somebody save me
Stop, wait a minute, stop sinking in it
Whoa not again, now stop it, you're exaggerating, stop

Verse 2:
Eyes wide open late at night, in my head an endless fight
My soul is tired and weak, the pain is so deep
Anxiety is daily, its a constant uphill battle
My thoughts can't be tamed, my emotions feel like a rattle
My goals are fading, there's no escaping this
I'm trying hard to stay afloat, I'm running out of patience
I'm done trying, I'm done trying, the guilt is vicious

Verse 1
I'm tryin' to change but it's never enough
Can't a man just get a break and some luck?
My patience is wearing thin, I'm starting to buckle
I'm questioning my fate, got me feeling troubled
It's like my life's a puzzle, every piece's wrong
Chaos reigns inside my head, like I'm in a storm
I can't escape this darkness, I need to find the light
Somebody save me, call me up and make it right

Chorus
Somebody save me from myself
Somebody save me, stop, wait a minute
Stop sinking in it, whoa, not again now
Stop it, you're exaggerating, stop

Verse 2
It's like I'm living in a prison, can't break these chains
My only chance of redemption is someone to save me
My life's a ticking time bomb, I'm running from the blast
Each day I'm on the edge of death, trepidation fast
My future's looking bleak and my hope is gone
A savior's what I need, I'm praying someone will come
My heart feels strained, all my strength is lost
Somebody, save me, be the one to pay the cost

Somebody save me from myself
Somebody save me, stop, wait a minute
Stop sinking in it, whoa, not again now
Stop it, you're exaggerating, stop

Take away my worries and make them disappear

Two ways of livin it's a thin line between the dark and the light,
Too many people gettin' down for the wrong kind of fight,
I'm livin' my life for something divine,
Still the killer in the street and the noise on the grind,
The trap singers screamin' out of the bricks,
I'm tryin' to escape but it seems I'm caught in a fix,
This wicked world got me runnin' in circles,
The struggle just keeps on and it's only gettin' worse,

Out here it's like a jungle and sometimes I think I might go mad,
Tryin' to make sense of life with some mix of the good and the bad,
Focusin' on the positive above the particles of dust,
The cycle of chaos will never be enough,
The masses overflowin' with no solution or control,
The answer is within us but too many are livin' on parole,

These too many people they come in peace,
Some show love and some cause grief,
The bottom line is not to forget,
Cuz there's too many people, too many people in a net,
The streets, the schools, the churches, all filled to the brim,
Too many people livin' in a state of sin,
So don't fall victim to the traps set by the elite,
Stop the fight back and bring love and peace to the street,

Too many people ah too much too many people,
Ah too much too many people,
Ah too much too many people,
Time to time a change and make sure we get it right,
Building a future that's bright,
Putting our plans into action and taking a stand,
Achieve our dreams and make the world a better land,
The power of hope, courage, and unity will never expire,
Too many people livin' in the fire,
So don't forget your real worth,
It's time to break out of this prison of earth,
Too many people livin' in fear,
Too many people livin' in despair,
But we got the strength,
To build a better world with love and peace,
Too many people ah too much too many people,
Ah too much too many people,
Ah too much too many people.",rap

The temperature's risin, the streets can't take it no more 
Police try to keep the peace, but there's a racial war 
The rich getting richer, the poor just can't cope 
Kids ain't got no hope, just a steady flow of dope 
The news ain't helping, just headlines of gunplay 
You gotta stay one step ahead, if you try to get away 
We gotta find a way, to take control of our lives 
Put down the guns, come together and make it right 

They try to pin us down and keep us in a box 
But life ain't no 9 to 5, it's a twist and a shock 
No matter where you move, it's the same situation 
So we hit the street, with just one mission 

Too much, too much, too many people
Trying to survive with too little freedom 
Too much, too much, too many people
How long, we got to struggle just to make it through 

The daily grind gets harder, we can't take no more 
The game's a vicious circle, and it don't keep no score 
We gotta stay strong, and never give in 
We can't let them win, and never forget where we been 

Too much, too much, too many people
Trying to survive with too little freedom 
Too much, too much, too many people
How long, we got to struggle just to make it through 

They try to keep us down, with lies and manipulation 
But we see right through it all, it's time for liberation 
Tired of being oppressed, yeah, still we remain 
So when it's time to stand up, we don't feel no shame 

Too much, too much, too many people
Trying to survive with too little freedom 
Too much, too much, too many people
How long, we got to struggle just to make it through",rap

From all of the fame, the fortune and glory
But I still can't compete with the ones with the story
Chorus

The devil and angel fightin', no more livin' in the fall
I can feel the fame around me, still I just can't believe
Its almost like its burying me alive

Verse 2
On my back I feel the weight of the world
Pushin' me down, in a prison cell unknown
The struggles of success, where I just can't control
The envy of others lurks, always eatin' at my soul

I'm buried alive, tryin' to make sense of it all
The devil and angel fightin', no more livin' in the fall
I can feel the fame around me, still I just can't believe

The masks I wear in life, show a broken heart
A life of fame, yet can't seem to get a start
The voices in my head, creatin' a mental torture
But I keep on tryin', cuz I know I can't succumb to death

I keep it street cause I rule the rhyme
My flow is on fire like kerosene, Chinese dragon breath
It vibrates the souls of those on death
Rapping from the gods of the East
Been in the game since the days of funk
No one can match my lyrical sun
Able to blaze up the dark with a spark
My rhythm and rhymes bust weapons sound clear and stark

I come from the hood and bring hell from above
My thoughts make the heavens turn in love
My words invade the minds of the weak
It's a gift only for some to speak

Can't be held back and I can't be slowed
My bars'll knock 'em out cold
Spit a fire hotter than the sun
Everyone's gonna know I've come

Put an end to the nonsense and the beat skipping
My bars so hot they start sizzling
What I write in a verse is like magic tricks
Copperfield grab your chick Cop a feel cock the Glock for real
Give you some cop appeal dynamite vest
Na I ain't stressing nothing with a smiley face sticker on my detonator button
Haters ask is he bluffing or is he bugging
I don't know but I don't fuck with weed with the seed stuffing
What I blaze gets me oh so higher
Burn more white widow smoke than an old folks home on fire

I make change cha-ching I can hang a playground from a charm
You should see the way my chain swings
You got the balls to diss won't have 'em afterwards
Cause when I rap contenders get killed after all my words
I'm tired of all you rapping nerds trying to critique my shit
Like I ain't the motherfucking master of the baddest verbs
Celph Titled and the AOTP alliance will travel back in time
Smack ya have your baby teeth flying
I am Rob Zombie I am the Omni of dishonesty
I'm a prodigy an atrocity not a lot of promise in me
Positively not a drop of modesty my philosophy is the policy
I believe in nothing try teaching a beast peace and loving
Juggling my beliefs need readjusting
My life was sticks and rocks kick punch block
It was not a box of butterscotch and shuttlecocks

I have filled a pot of mud spilled a lot of blood
Watch the drops drip and flood hit the top stud
I have crashed a lot of waves dug a lot of graves
Drunk a lot of grapes I have fucked a lot of babes
I'm do not disturb I have punched a lot of nerds
Struck a lot of curbs I have cut a lot of curves
You are none of the above push come to shove you're all mother fucking
Puppy lovin country clubs y'all motherfuckers ain't running shit
Y'all simply runaways I walk the surface of the sun
While you're rocking stunner shades I'm in hell shoving flames
While you're sweating summer days I'm the son of Satan son of Sam sicker some'll say

Got a flow so cold that I could blow the sun away
Even if I kick a free someone still gonna pay
You could get blasted body in a funeral casket
And cops searching for deoxyribonucleic acid

Slay the fascists Pharaoh fans pray for classics
Come through in Raiders jackets to make this magic
I'm a holy man voodoo priest rebel that'll shoot police
You wake up from this nightmare and change your little doodoo sheets
Skeleton crusher creature from the cryo chamber
The naughty nasty trashy microphone annihilator
It's AP apparently you motherfuckers missed me
Some dude tried to diss me now that kid's history
Now this is a misery I heard it needs company
Who the fuck else want to bleed in their dungarees?
Planetary man the evil rap desert eagle clap
All your people get ready for the sequel
Needle set to vinyl now it's time for your final thought
What's your last wish you's a minor fine in court
Twenty-five to life rap electric chair spit a sick",rap

Verse one
I'm a master of the mic, and a king of the throne
I'ma spray my lyrical fire, coming out of my cone 
My flow's so nice, when I'm spittin I be on one 
Carrying styles no one's seen, so what I spit's like a stun 
I got bars that's loaded and ready, time to let 'em go 
Y'all shoot blanks but I'm flamethrower, here to let it show 
I'mma take ya head off, and put it on my shelf 
Let y'all know that I'm the king, I can do it by myself 
I'm the one that's bringing the swag, and stepping in the light 
Better keep the distance, you try to step in, I'mma bite 
Ya'll no talent mumble rappers, I'mma put you in check 
My pen and pad, its a weapon, so we can talk in tech

Verse two
I'm a lyrical assassin, I'm gonna hit 'em with the heat 
I'mma put my foot on the gas, no time for me to sleep 
I'm leaving all the doubters in the dust, tryin to make moves 
My rhymes come like a gunshot, so don't make me prove 
My sharp tongue slicing your ears, pierce it with my darts 
Ready to leave you in tears, no time to mend your heart 
These bars are like a tsunami, when they come they won't stop 
My music like a light that brightens up the dark top 
My flow is like the wind, never can be seen 
I'mma make ya head spin, my rhymes rude like a fiend 
I'mma take you for a ride, gonna be a hell of a trip 
My rhymes like a cobra, gonna be ready to spit",rap

No time to waste, to the beat we shall be
One day it'll all make sense, come and join the ride
Let's get down and lose ourselves in the flow of the night

Let's go out and take a chance, make some memories
Together we'll find our way, to our own victories
This music, it won't take us to the end
But if you stay with me, it will be our best friend

Chorus:
Welcome to the LP, come and ride with me
No time to waste, to the beat we shall be
One day it'll all make sense, come and join the ride
Let's get down and lose ourselves in the flow of the night

Bridge:
I want to take you to places that I've been
A place I want to go, a place I can begin
I'll open up my mental window, so climb on in
This music, it ain't all that I got
But it does mean a lot to me

Chorus:
Welcome to the LP, come and ride with me
No time to waste, to the beat we shall be
One day it'll all make sense, come and join the ride

I aim to teach and share, bringing positivity in the air,
Letting the vibes flow, so all can be aware.

Raising the bar and always taking the top spot.

Spin em in the hood and they be like who the fella

If you don't know why I'm talking I'm talking about the dough
Hit the icey block in my icy clothes
Gettin paid like an executive I'm finna flow

I flew to Cali and smoked out the zip
Had a baddie come suck up the tip
3400 in my Beverly Hills

Round up the gang then we come to a jam

Verse 1:
I hear the pain in your voice, the pain and disbelief
And I know it's hard to understand and it's hard to believe
That the love we had was so real and so divine
But instead of letting it heal us, you chose to decline
And why, why oh why did you run away?
And why, why oh why did you take it away?

Chorus:
Maybe I didn't deserve you,
Maybe I just couldn't cure you,
They told me that I didn't hurt you,
Why do I feel like I turned you?

Maybe I don't understand it,
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded,
Maybe I'm too much to manage?

Verse 2:
You thought I was the one to blame and I just couldn't reconcile
But when I look back, I can only see one thing that would make sense
And that is that you thought I'd been the one to betray
But even if I had, I think it still would have been okay

Bridge:
And why, why oh why did you turn away?
And why, why oh why did you take it away?
It's hard to understand how you could be so cold
But I held on tightly and believed we'd be old

Maybe I didn't deserve you,
Maybe I just couldn't cure you,
They told me that I didn't hurt you,
Why do I feel like I turned you?

Maybe I'm too much to manage?",rap

Verse 1:
Don't say I'm not the one who never showed up,
I tried to be there when you needed a friend
But when I needed you, you weren't around,
I never knew my love was so misconstrued.

Chorus:
Maybe I didn't deserve you,
Maybe I just couldn't cure
They told me that I didn't hurt you,
Why do I feel like I turned you?

Verse 2:
So much confusion and uncertainty,
I never knew the truth from the lies
I wanted to be there for you in the night,
But I guess I was just too blind to see.

I got a waitress on the floor tryin' to give me some face.

They play some Lil Wayne mixed with some T-Pain,
They mashed the Journey record and now they droppin' Coldplay,
And now they playin' my song and the girls are showin' they thong,

Locked away in a dungeon, my story's never been told
My eyes look forward, but my heart feels so cold
I take a deep breath, I can't take the pressure no more
Heaven holds the keys, just waiting for me to open the door

But in here, I can't escape the demons that lurk in the dark
I can't make sense of the endless pain in my heart
I'm freezing, can't move, can't scream, can't rest
Trying so hard to reclaim peace from this mental mess

I said goodbye to the light, I've fallen too far
My mind's still racing, trying to find who I are
My soul's in pain as I try to pick apart the pieces
I can feel it in my bones, I'm searching for a release

See I ain't trying to get high no more, tryna find a new way
I'mma keep it real, got no time to play games
My homies put me down and I just need one chance
To get back on track and put the pieces in place

But the world around me won't let me re-create
The past I once had, just vision, can't wait
My mental health's struggling, no way to get relief
So I'mma keep grinding and search for some relief

My eyes on the sky, I'mma keep fighting the storm
Every second that I'm alive, I'mma keep pushing on
The demons keep coming, but I just gotta remain calm
Cuz God's got me, I'mma be alright, and the pain will be gone.",rap

Flexin' through the streets with a .45, see the devil's eyes and hear him sing
Feelin' like Bruce Wayne, patrollin' the scene, got my Glock cocked, ready to please
My addiction, tweakin' on a morphine, jumpstartin' my heart with a hit of cocaine
My style is unique, living wild and free, fuckin' with me is a recipe for disaster
My crew is da best, stay strapped with the tech, leave em stiff and cold like a snowman
My reps is known, this life ain't a joke, never back down, and never throw it in the towel

I got choppers that make em wet, still dumping clips like a ocean full of nets
And I'ma pour out a cup for my homies in the grave, we gonna keep the legacy that they gave
They used to hate, but now they all recognize, I'm the gangsta rap queen with the dope rhymes

Smoking nicotine and popping Pills in my cuisine
Draped in suede, wrists dismayed, suicidal renegade
Pop a couple waves up in my grave, carving my skin with the blade

Always lickity-wrecked, bitch get checked, Grey 59 the set
Choppers make em wet, watch me flex, y'all just second best
Never second guess, manifest triple six until death
Ruby ain't my motherfucking true name
If I wrote it down, it would combust into a blue flame
Goom gang banging, whole crew slain, bodies in the suitcase
Polo body bag full of bootlegs, two-faced bitch, sick a duck
Got your bitch laying goose eggs, two fangs growing got a toothache
Tie me up like a shoestring, let the noose hang out my box
I need a new frame, Ruby da Cherry ain't got a pocket full of fruitcake
Bruce Wayne wannabe, fuck with me I'll probably give you something free
Honeys surrounding me 'cause I'm buzzing like a fucking bumblebee

Chorus:
Most of my raps are fucking tongue in cheek
Fungus in my lungs, dungeon reeks of crumbling weed
Another day, another fee, pile of fucking dirt you will find me underneath
Yah yah57, Yah yah57

Verse 2:
Shady schemes and hustles in between, it's gettin' kinda hectic
Police trying to find me out on the streets, I'm like a free technic
Dolla dollar bill, y'all, I'm tryin' to cheque the kill
I'm getting money, kicking around town like a bell ringer
Got me a big bankroll, stack it up tall, like Leprechaun Gold
Livin' life, tryin' to survive, another day I'm told
Better move fast, looking through my past
Life been hard, I'm blessed that I'm able to last
Put me in the hood, I'm bringing truth like a hoodie
I'm on the grind, I'm tryin' to make it out of poverty
Pull my trigger, I pull a stunt, the world shaking up
Hells Angels on my back, I'm tryin' to make an honest buck
In my world, my reign is supreme, I'm like a king
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, I'mma keep it clean
Grab my visa and passport, might take a trip
Another day, another night, just another flip

Chorus:
Most of my raps are fucking tongue in cheek
Fungus in my lungs, dungeon reeks of crumbling weed
Another day, another fee, pile of fucking dirt you will find me underneath
Yah yah57, Yah yah57",rap

Chorus:
Yo Yella kick the muthafucking break in

Yo Dr Dre, Dj Yella, Eazy E and I am Mc Ren
Yo NWA taking over this muthafucka Y all

Verse 1:
Never ask what I'm spittin' wit' cuz I'm quick to let the mic drop
And watch these suckers hit the floor they don't know what they on top
Because they don't understand the real lyrics that I'm makin'
Some of these jibber jabbers ain't speakin' real shit they be fakin'
Don't even come through unless you got an original style
On the beat with me cuz I don't wanna hear your freestyle
Drop a couple of lyrics I heard that sh*t a thousand times
Ain't gon' do nuttin' for ya won't leave ya with no shine

Verse 2:
I did it my way, no copy and paste
My flow is like heroin, so you can get binged up on my tape
Rock the mic from stage to stage, showin' 'em what I can do
You ain't ever heard real sh*t 'til you heard Mc Ren too
It's like a double dose, when I hold the mic I got you overdose
Hit you with the flow you never heard before, makin' my name known
Puttin' on for the NWA, so what you think we gonna do?
We gonna take this sh*t global and keep the whole clique true

Verse 3:
Common sense ain't so common, that's why I gotta set the bar
Hit the beat like a drum, cuz I'm here to take it far
What I'm doin' right now, all these real rappers straight trip
Y'all don't want none of my real sh*t, it's too wild to grip
Had the game on lock, way before I ever said go
So keep your eyes peeled and your ears open cuz I ain't done yet
With this rap game, I'm here to rock it nonstop
Every verse gon' be a classic, so you know it's time to top

Verse 4:
My rhymes like a recipe, so I gotta cook it up
Makin' sure the recipe is official and that I ain't got too much
Gotta give it to y'all, y'all don't even know what I'm about
Cuz what I'm spittin' out of my mouth is bound to make you shout
So listen up close and don't miss a single word
Hit the beat like a hammer and put the mic in the dirt
Bring the fire to y'all, the flames that burn my name
It's real niggas with the attitude, so you know we still the same",rap

For havin' an unstoppable force you couldn't break down.

Like that, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down,
It's like that, it's like that.

Open your eyes and adjust to the scenery,

The incentive, the pride I feel is independent.

Verse 1
I cut game with a razor blade and had to speak to the gods on everything I made
In this competitive game I sometimes do what it takes
Cause when the haters arise I rise to the challenge
I break down walls and obstacles with no hesitation
I'm unstoppable like the force of gravity
Find a direction, pursue with perfection
My pride is independent, focused and undefeatable
My flow is like a stream, I'm so damn real

Chorus
It's like that, 24/7 I be reppin'

It's like that and when I spit these raps it's like that

Verse 2
Early days of a rap cat, my heart goes out
To all the crack babies, their struggle so profound
I'm so greedy, I can't let you see me
Smoke, drink and talk shit on the Playstation 3
Fidel Castro with a cigar, late nights in the town
Doin it solo, then I first saw a gangsta cry
And until the day I die that moment will live on in my mind
My flow is like a hurricane, used to bust a ballerina
Living it raw in the city, without no hesitation

Chorus
It's like that, 24/7 I be reppin'
It's like that, I'm gon hit the club with Billy
It's like that sometimes I wish it wasn't
It's like that and when I spit these raps it's like that

My hustle was raised in the projects, in the coffin of fame
Keepin it real and livin it up, no one could contain
I'm on a mission, ain't no stoppin' this beautiful goal
Mickey stay dead serious, doin' the math in control
And when they say I couldn't make it, I don't hesitate
I make a reality out of all that I imagine
It's like that with no hesitation, I remain free
Living it up, word to Cassius Clay

Chorus
It's like that, 24/7 I be reppin'

In the club, lookin' for the kitty to mate
From the corner to the bridge, I keep cruisin'

Kitty cats everywhere, begin my wild ride
Ooh, there's one, and another

Kill the beat, take the crown, put them in the ground
We gonna put them in the ground, come on and make a sound

Outta 'em, leavin' 'em, with nothin' but tears

Holdin' it down, Wu-Tang family crest
No one is hidin', we got what they need
Gotta put up your dukes and just agree

Yall better step aside when I come through the yard
With the Wu-Tang twenty years strong

Gonna keep it real, gonna keep it true, gonna show these phonies up
You can try your shots, but I'm gon' stay intact, yup

Chorus
Fuck all them industry motherfuckers, I'm done with this game
I'm gonna take my shot and let 'em know I'm not the one to blame
So take my money, take my pride, I don't care what I'm gonna lose
Cause ain't no way I'm gonna let you play me like a fool

Bridge
Stopped believing in all their lies, gonna stand with what I know is right
I got something to prove and I'm gonna be the one who holds the light
So fuck all them industry motherfuckers and to be continued soon

Chorus
Fuck all them industry motherfuckers, I'm done with this game

Verse 1:
All these industry motherfuckers think they so shrewd
But I'm here to put 'em in their place, somethin' they ain't used to
Try to put me down, but I don't break like some twigs
Pull up to the club, walk in it like I own the crib
Bands stackin' up 'cause I'm comin' with the heat
Takin' it back to the old school, makin' 'em feel the beat

Chorus:
Fuck all them industry motherfuckers, to be continued soon
Yeah, they ain't gon' stop me, I'ma keep it movin'

Verse 2:
Got these haters blabberin' in their sleep
I'm livin' life too fast, they just can't keep up with me
I'm too legit to quit, like MC Hammer said
Don't come in my path, 'less you ready to sweat
I'm climbin' up that ladder, can't nobody deny
Gotta stay focused when I'm droppin' these rhymes

Chorus:
Fuck all them industry motherfuckers, to be continued soon
Yeah, they ain't gon' stop me, I'ma keep it movin'

Verse 3:
Don't put me in a box, this ain't for the faint-hearted
I'm risin' to the top, like I never had no start
My flow so cold, all the ice up in Antarctica
Been flowin' for a minute, showin' these fools no mercy
Don't put me in the back, I'm gonna stay front-lined
Tell all them industry motherfuckers, it's gonna be mine

Verse 1:
I'm gonna bust up out the grave, it's not like I'm in chains
They can't keep me here, this ain't no prison, it's just a game
I hear the people talking, staring in disbelief
It's like they can't believe that I'm alive, I can feel the heat
I'm six feet deep and all I hear is 'shut your mouth'
But I'm already awake, I don't need to be kept down

Chorus:
Let me take you back in time, up to my coffin now
All I hear is crying, my obituary printed on a clouds
My face is pale, my spirit's high and I'm risen up
A preacher is calling out, telling me it's over, nobody can reach me, saying so long
But before you run and cry, somebody's calling out and yelling
""Come out! Wake, wake, wake 'em up now!""

Verse 2:
I walk out of my grave, looking fresh and feeling alive
My suit is black, my tie is tight, I'm back to stay and thrive
So now you know me, call me Lazarus, I'm a former dead man walking
They couldn't keep me down, the Lord, He set me free
My report was missing, all these lies, they can't be true
Headed for a truck, speeding like a bike and running a light
But I was alive, before the life was drained from my sight

Chorus:
Let me take you back in time, up to my coffin now
All I hear is crying, my obituary printed on a clouds
My face is pale, my spirit's high and I'm risen up
A preacher is calling out, telling me it's over, nobody can reach me, saying so long
But before you run and cry, somebody's calling out and yelling
""Come out! Wake, wake, wake 'em up now!""

Verse 3:
The power of the Lord, it's strong, like a wire
The electricity flowing, He's connected to me like a fire
Dead men don't talk, and lies, they ain't real
My death warrant was signed off, but I was risen up before it dried
Time to wake up the believers, the meek and the strong
When your life's at a low, remember the power that He already shown

Chorus:
Let me take you back in time, up to my coffin now
All I hear is crying, my obituary printed on a clouds
My face is pale, my spirit's high and I'm risen up
A preacher is calling out, telling me it's over, nobody can reach me, saying so long
But before you run and cry, somebody's calling out and yelling
""Come out! Wake, wake, wake 'em up now!""

Outro:
Poppin' out the grave, it's a thriller style
They didn't think I could make it, but I did for a while
The Captain, the Almighty Lord, He sets captives free
Aboard, no stoppin' Him, when His mind is made up, see
My grave is cleaned out, so com'ere and look into my eyes
You'll see the fire, spread the word, I'm alive
Call me Lazarus, former dead man, walkin' tall
I'm alive and I'm here, I just answered the Lord's call",rap
"

I'm livin' resurrection, no time to take a restin'
My people hopin' I'd awaken and come out of my crypt

Lazarus, yeah that's me, don't front, you know the name
My resurrection story's spread like wildfire, you feel the flame
The power of the Lord I can never explain
But I'm breathin' and livin' proof the Savior can raise the slain

I'm hopin' out the coffin, rise from the dead
My Lord, He's my soul protector, I pledge Him my head
The devil thought he got me, but Jesus came to my rescue
Accomplishin' another miracle, praising Him with words of joy

Wake 'em up now, raise 'em up now
The Lord got us, ain't no need to doubt
Stand up now, put feet to faith, let's fight now
Our Lord has done it again, can't nobody keep us down

They said I was done and gone, on my way to the lake of fire
But I'm alive, lookin' hotter than ever, the grave ain't nothin' to me
Let me tell you who I am, never stoppin', tryin' to get more people to stand
In the name of Jesus, showin' you a better way to land

From now on, you can call me Lazarus, baby
From now on, you can call me Lazarus
From now on, you can call me Lazarus, baby
Former dead man walking, Lazarus

My Lord gave me strength and courage, He told me stand, I did it
Although it wasn't easy, He gave me the power of everlasting
I'm living in the moment, giving God all of my devotion
Grateful for His grace and mercy, I'm a new man in motion

Wake 'em up now, raise 'em up now
Break off the chains and worry no how
Stand up now, put feet to faith, let's fight now
Our Lord has done it again, can't nobody keep us down

From now on, you can call me Lazarus, baby
From now on, you can call me Lazarus
From now on, you can call me Lazarus, baby
Former dead man walking, Lazarus

My resurrection was the most amazing thing to happen
Their disbelief disappeared, when I came out of that casket
A dead man can't holla, that's what they said, but look at me
My story was a shock to the world, when they heard it on the streets

Wake 'em up now, raise 'em up now
Ima bless the Lord, let me show you how
Stand up now, put feet to faith, let's fight now
Our Lord has done it again, can't nobody keep us down

From now on, you can call me Lazarus, baby

The pressure is on in this big city, I gotta make moves fast or I'm gonna be finished,
Seems like this town's got money, power and fame but I'm still strugglin',
I'm livin' a double life, caught up between the hood and the dream,
Gotta put in the work, gotta hustle every day in between.

I'm goin' to the studio even when I'm feelin' low,
In the booth I let it out and let the mic know,
Effects of the culture, can't turn my back on poverty,
Takin' what I learned and tryin' to make a name for me.

Caught in the middle of this world, can't find the way out,

Don't waste time in the shadows, don't let the critics bring me down,
It's about gettin' it done, with a hustle and a sound,
One move and I can get to the top,
The ground's shaking under my feet, and I'm gonna never stop.

Taking my rhymes to the street, bars and clubs,
I'm gettin' respect as I move and connect,
On the way to make it, no doubt I'm gonna show em,
It's not about me and my needs, it's all about a flowin' free.

Pain and struggle, day and night, it's clear to me, 
Puttin' in the time, won't rest until I'm successful and free,
Givin' what I got, with heart and soul,
It's my dream that I'm livin', and I'm gonna keep on rollin.

Never knew what could be, so I'm gonna take a chance,
When I move forward, it's the only way for me to advance,
Luck and future, all I ever had,
On the stage I'm gonna rock it, no matter how bad.

Chasing dreams, the chase never stops, but in the end the dreams are all we got
Climbing walls, we tryin' to make it out of this maze with no options but to escape
Livin' life like it's an open mic, rapin' to the beat 'til the lyrics come to life
Confronting fears, tryin' to make it out of this hell, stuck in the darkness craving the light

I'm livin' in the moment, takin' every step with precision
The future's uncertain, but I'ma make my decisions
Soaring through the sky like a bird, but still I can't shake this feeling of dread
I'm towing my dreams, in the hopes of reachin' the end
And finally, my voice'll be heard when the beat stops

The clock's ticking, but I'm gonna make it out of this mess
No matter what, I'm gonna stay ahead of the rest
Gettin' pushed to the brink, but I keep pushin' on
Feelin' like I'm at the end, but I'm just gettin' started, so come on

I rap to keep my soul alive, and learn to keep on fightin'
Tryin' hard to stay alive, no matter how hard it gets
Livin' life like a song, each word is a step of progress
My life is the beat, and I'm the flow, so come on, let me show

No one to trust, no one to guide me, livin' life in the dark was never easy
But even when the light's out, I'ma stay, 'til I make it out of this place
Never gonna stop chasing my dreams, 'cause I'ma be livin' the life I choose
I'ma keep on rappin' the truth, even if nobody wants to hear it

Walking down the street with a sense of dread, hear the words of people saying what they said, 'bout war and hate, about death and fate, about what this life has come to become.

This ain't just a dream, but it's something we can no longer ignore, and it's time we realize that this hate got to go, got to start looking out for each other, got to show and share the love.

Listen up everybody and share this message of peace,
This world needs more unity and togetherness.
It's time we stand together and throw away the guns,
Stand up and fight the hate, and make sure hope won't run.

This is a war to see who's right, and you can see that it's wrong,
Opression has no place in this world, so let's stand up and turn it on.

See that everyone of us has a right to be here and be free,

Listen up everybody, it's time to change the game
The world is ripe in fear, we never been the same
If you ain't heard the news, then you need to get informed
The level of control yo, it's getting fully warmed
It's black and white, no matter who ya be
Don't need activism to see that it's not right to me
If money and power control the course of our fate
Then the whole system is just a race to the grave

To those working in banks and in armed service ranks
To all the children born and raised in internment camps
To all the youth sittin in front of their TVs at home
Listen up everybody, we need to fight for our own
See, the power of belief can overcome the pain
But too many get lost and fall into the dark domain
You're in safe hands, and you're not alone
We'll fight the system's gears, to get back our home

The cycle hits hard, when you've got no ground to stand on
We're trying to break free, and find our own place in the sand
You don't like the system, but you still keep it alive
It's time to rise up, and make them show our side

Patriotism is the core of this whole generation
We live in, no it ain't the beginning
Your life's at risk, and you might be conscripted
Sent off to fight, in a place where the air's like nitroglycerin
Every night you pray, to come home and see your wife and kids again

The cycle's vicious, when you're sitting in between
Would you die for your pride, it's an old-school way to dream
You gotta ask yourself, are you not surprised
When they cock their guns, and commit the Nazi crimes

So put your mind to it, and lay yo' soul down to sleep
Pray to have some ground to keep, and be free without the need to hold the chrome
It always seems so much worse, when it's close to home
Listen up everybody, it's yo' choice, yo' fate, yo' dome

We gotta break these chains, and reclaim our place
Just sendin these kids off to their death, ain't the way
We gotta take a stand and show the public face
Let's fight the system, and put racism in its place

Witness the power of unity, and know that's what we need
To protect our children, and have their future guaranteed
The bottom line is, that they got us all falling in line
Let's show them who's the boss, and put that hate way behind

As I lay my soul down to sleep, I reach deep
Pray to have some ground to keep, and be free without the need to hold the chrome
It always seems so much worse, when it's close to home
As I lay my soul down to sleep, I pray the Lord save my friends and family, and keep me
Please protect my boundaries, I listen to the bombs fall

Woulda been a mess if we had decided to stick it out
That bit was a bad move, no doubt
Young and wild, heart made of stone
The things going through my head, I'd have been on the phone
Tried to talk it out, seemed like it made it worse
She'll always be there if I had to reverse

Chorus
I couldn't help it, no mean
I couldn't help it for real
I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been somethin' goin' on inside
No lie, I couldn't help it
I couldn't help it, naw I couldn't help it

Verse 2
Take it from me, be careful, things can change
One second it's great, then you'd be out of range
In a situation I didn't plan, got stuck
Had to make moves, thought 'bout a child, what the fuck?
Thinking 'bout an abortion, acting like a savage
Accident on purpose so I'd have a miscarriage
My mom and hers, I can't see 'em like that
Besides, what kind of mother would she ever be at?

Chorus
I couldn't help it, no mean
I couldn't help it for real
I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been somethin' goin' on inside
No lie, I couldn't help it
I couldn't help it, naw I couldn't help it

Verse 3
See my little dude, look him in his eyes
But I know he can't understand, gotta apologize
Why would I not want him around, bein' selfish
Had my mind on other things, so inconsiderate
Lookin' at my reflection and seein' he's like me
It's like lookin' in a mirror, can't change it can't flee
We go through phases, sold millions on the charts
He and his girl's been together for years, that's the art

Chorus
I couldn't help it, no mean
I couldn't help it for real
I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been somethin' goin' on inside
No lie, I couldn't help it
I couldn't help it, naw I couldn't help it

Verse 4
People think it's crazy, but it happens all the time
See her in Vegas, can't lie and say I'm doin' fine
We exchange numbers, so much got said
I know better, bitches ain't faithful, that's what Snoop said
Back to the club, partyin' like it's all good
She's touchin' me, looks uncomfortable like she should
Music changes, I started grindin' on her friend
Now she's trippin', I'm starting to comprehend

Chorus
I couldn't help it, no mean
I couldn't help it for real
I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been somethin' goin' on inside
No lie, I couldn't help it
I couldn't help it, naw I couldn't help it",rap

Verse 1
I was always out chasing bags, and she was out chasing dreams
We should've known that it wasn't meant to last, no matter how hard we tried to scheme
But I was so young, I wanted all the fame
Plus I was out chasing hoes, and that put a wide gap in between
I put it on paper and spoke real honest
But at the end of the day I was still heartless
I thought I was ready for it, but I was wrong
I thought I was stronger than this, but I didn't know I was so gone

Chorus
How could I not want you here and be that selfish
Fuck was on my mind at the time, my bad
I couldn't help it, no mean I couldn't help it
For real I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been something going on inside, no lie
I couldn't help it, I couldn't help it

Verse 2
I'm in the hood trying to survive, living on a budget plan
I could barely take care of myself, let alone a son or a man
My decisions felt like a mistake, the way life was meant to go
But when she showed up pregnant, I knew I had to let go
Must have figured she was a psycho, to be honest with myself
Having a baby that young was something I just couldn't be doin'
I was so blind with all the fame and my little cash flow
I should've known this tension would intensify from smoke shows

Chorus
How could I not want you here and be that selfish
Fuck was on my mind at the time, my bad
I couldn't help it, no mean I couldn't help it
For real I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been something going on inside, no lie
I couldn't help it, I couldn't help it

Verse 3
I was out in the clubs, trying to forget it all
But when I saw her and her rock, I thought, “Oh man here we go”
She was with another dude, and I was with a friend
It felt like a twisted dream we never wanted to end
We shared a few drinks, I had to see what she said
She told me his lifestyle, and all the things he did
She felt like he was never home, the kids never felt loved
And now here she was, trying to find another way out

Chorus
How could I not want you here and be that selfish
Fuck was on my mind at the time, my bad
I couldn't help it, no mean I couldn't help it
For real I couldn't help it, even though I tried
Must have been something going on inside, no lie
I couldn't help it, I couldn't help it",rap

Yeah
Roll with me to La-La Land
Grow up in the hood, hustlin' for the fans
They say don't come around, but I take a stand
Ain't gonna break for for nothin' in these streets
Gotta get it done before the sun goes down
Gotta make that money so I hop around
The city's alive, alive with lights and sound
Living wild and free, no worries in my life

Today's the day, it's my time to shine
My style's fresh, got heat up on my mind
Money in my hand, girls on my grind
On a mission in the city, let's get it right

Chorus

Los Angeles damn, I love this town
Sure feels good to be home
Look when you come to LA, you gonna see
Models cost money but the hood rats are free
They're looking so good, I can't keep from flashing
I'm not drunk, baby, but they're here for asking
They say don't go to the park, I'm going anyway
I throw a real house party like I'm getting paid
And when this shit pops off, it happens everyday
Come to where I stay, I love LA

Verse 2

Cash up and ride, from the East to the West Coast
Got a spot at the top, and I'm makin' it close
Music in my head and reppin' from my soul
Been around the world, it's back to the old Hoe
Daily grind, that's the hustle for me
Showing off my skill and makin' history
Ain't no limit to what I can do
Time to get the money, a night to break the rules

Chorus

Los Angeles damn, I love this town
Sure feels good to be home
Look when you come to LA, you gonna see
Models cost money but the hood rats are free
They're looking so good, I can't keep from flashing
I'm not drunk, baby, but they're here for asking
They say don't go to the park, I'm going anyway
I throw a real house party like I'm getting paid
And when this shit pops off, it happens everyday
Come to where I stay, I love LA

Verse 3

Ain't no limit to what I can take
No hesitation, no holding back
Open up my eyes, I'm really feeling this life
Time to make it happen, I do it tonight

Compton, Long Beach, beaches on the Sunday
Girl sunsets, hood lights, hit me in the day
Ain't no rules and regulations, just do what you do
Live your life, and do what you want to

Chorus

Los Angeles damn, I love this town
Sure feels good to be home
Look when you come to LA, you gonna see

Verse 1
Yeah, this is not a wig, it's really real
If it was, it'd come off right about now
I dyed it black, you like my shirt it says Mt. Vernon
'Cause that's where I actually live, how in the fuck
Are you 'bout to say the way that we do it isn't the way?
No, don't you sweat it, don't be in the way
Nothing you do can put an end to my day
Cashed up, in my bed, I lay, look to the ceiling and drift away
Stressing and checking on me for a blessing, but I can't hear nothing, I'm gone for the day

Chorus
Sure, you can afford that, I get it
Lookin' like a bum, only think I'm holdin' pennies
Pull out your mortgage, just spend it in a minute
Take it how you want it, get mad when you get it
Blame everyone around you for the money you ain't gettin'
Boy, man up to the life you ain't livin'
Time they get chiller, sometimes I forgive him

Verse 2
My mind's on a rhythm, so don't mess up when I see you
Loose neck cotton chains, bangin' off my body, soundin' like a dog walkin', razor barkin'
If you buy me, let the scotch light blind 'em
Let the switch, restyle 'em, I ain't never goin' back to what I did back in Howell
Old bones, new flow, still flickin' ash up on my clothes
1800 Deadboy if they need to hit my phone
Estate sell Ogles on my finger make me hopeful
We ain't never goin' back to nickel dimmin' for some produce",rap
"

Verse 1
My look is always changing, never stay the same
Hit up the store, get some new clothes and dye my mane
My shirt says Mt. Vernon, urban swag supreme
Cuz that's where I actually live, for that you can vouch
Don't be fooled, how I do it ain't no doubt
I'm always causin' a stir and showin' em what's it about
I'm cashed up and sleepin' like a king in my bed
I stare up at the ceiling and mentally I'm fed
Pressure got them checkin' up on me daily
But no matter the stress, my days can never be shady

Chorus
Cotton chains hangin' off my body
Sound like a dog walkin' heard when it barkin'
Gotta keep it movin', everybody gotta shine
Caught up in the moment, but still nickel and dime

Verse 2
Might look like a bum, but I'm holdin' that penny
Pull out that mortgage, spends it up in a jiffy
Take it how you want it, but when you get mad
You can't blame nobody for the money you ain't had
Man up to the life, can't give in to temptation
Mind's on a rhythm, don't let that derange ya
Let the scotch blind 'em, let the switch restyle 'em
Never gonna go back to my days in Howell
Old bones, new flow, flickin' ash up on my clothes
Call up the deadboy, if they ever need to hit my phone
Estate sale got those ogles on my finger, make me hopeful
Never gonna go back, nickel and dime for some produce",rap

Brick stacks, no stress, watching the cashflow
No time for rest, now watch the show

Every day is a blessing, never gonna miss a blink
Lookin' at the sky, it's a star lit night
I'm with my team and we getting right

The bars hit so hard, watch it make 'em fly it

Verse 1
What is common, what is normal, what is wrong with me in the end?
How will I be judged, a skull to hold the worms, a body to cradle dust?
If it means becoming like these wrinkled people with shriveled lives,
I'll forfeit this shadow game of compromise tonight.

Chorus
I might swim too far and the shore will fade and I'll be gone
One day they will say just look at her now
One day they will say we thought she'd drown
In the tidal crush of muck that sucked her to the ground.
They will kneel, shiver, and beg:
What pushed you over the edge?
Cuts, bruises, ruined brain, fluid, cigarette burns,
The monsters taking turns.

One day they will pray, save us from this hell!
One day they will pray, save the weak and frail.
One day they will pray, save us from ourselves,
And I'll say it's too late, you've summoned the devil within me.
You should be running, you amuse me.
Sluts, losers, subhuman lice, and tumors.

Feed it, fuck it, breed it, eat it,
Their perfume still haunts this room,
Sensual phantoms, fingers and lips,
Cradle the evidence, mine, mine, mine.
Awaken to the rhythm of my own voice
And the beat of the drums in my head.
We remain animals, feral or tame.
We remain animals, we remain animals
We remain animals, feral or tame.

A beast of iron plague, cuts and bruises, cigarette burns,
The monsters taking turns.

No more monsters taking turns, it's time to make a return
To the land of the honest and pure, nothing left to endure

I'm done with the cut, done with the bruises
Done with the cigarette burns, and done with the excuses
It's time to rise up and break the chains
No more will we remain, animals in these chains

No more pain I will feel, no more fear I will heal
No more sorrow I will find, no more darkness in my mind
I'm ready to break the chains and be who I'm meant to be
A rising hope of humanity, and liberty

My heart and my soul, so strong and so bold
Ready to take on what comes, no longer will I be sold
Today I start a new journey, and I'll be setting the tone

Girl you got something special no doubt
Every time I'm with you I'm left in shock
The beauty that you show it got me tied in knots
My confidence seems gone when your around a lot

Chorus 
Oh, But girl you got me speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
Yeah, your beauty got me all bottled up
Girl you got me speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
Yeah, I need some patience to find the words I'm lookin for

Verse 2 
My mind is confused and my heart is racing
Caught up in emotions and I ain't used to chasing
But I'm so attracted to the beauty of your face
And I know that one day I won't be so amazed

Chorus 
Oh, But girl you got me speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
Yeah, your beauty got me all bottled up
Girl you got me speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
Yeah, I need some patience to find the words I'm lookin for

Bridge 
There's something inside of you that's too hard to ignore
It's like a magnet drawing me in for more
Your touch, your look, your talk, it's something I adore
Girl you got me speechless, like never before

Chorus 
Oh, But girl you got me speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
Yeah, your beauty got me all bottled up
Girl you got me speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
Yeah, I need some patience to find the words I'm lookin for",rap

Verse 1:
My gun's loaded, I got a grip, watch your step, don't slip
Gotta get what I'm owed, livin' on the streets, no respect
Yeah, I'm a hustler, always been, it's the way of life, what can I say?
Gotta do what I do to survive in this game
Cops always lurking, lurking and lurking, like they want trouble
Gonna stay low, and keep hustlin', cause I'ma never double

Chorus:
And that's how we do it, livin' in the hood no justice, no peace
Mr. Policeman, ain't no help in this street
No donuts and coffee, no more of that
The only thing you'll see is an infrared scope, and a gat

Verse 2:
Don't get it twisted, I'm just trying to make it right
Still livin' in the dark, never seen the light
Gotta find a way to get out of this slump
Gotta be a grown man, gotta do what I gotta do, gotta be the king
Gangsters, thugs and hustlers, that's the way of life
Everybody's got a plan, gotta get mine and get out of this strife

Chorus:
And that's how we do it, livin' in the hood no justice, no peace
Mr. Policeman, ain't no help in this street
No donuts and coffee, no more of that
The only thing you'll see is an infrared scope, and a gat

Verse 3:
Tried my best to stay out of trouble, but the cops track me like a dog
Gotta stick together, show each other some love
It's hard livin' out here, it's enough to put you in the ground
Spit bars and do the rhymes, that's the only way to get around
Gonna grind and make it right, no matter what I gotta do
We gotta get this money, we gotta get it cuz we gotta get through

Chorus:
And that's how we do it, livin' in the hood no justice, no peace
Mr. Policeman, ain't no help in this street
No donuts and coffee, no more of that

Holding it down in the hood they know its me 
Money in my jeans and I'm feeling so free 
Gangsters among us and I got the streets in a frenzy 
Them suicide doors open and I'm feeling so canny 
Yeah those boys hustle but I got a different job 
I'm playing the gangster for the whole hood to watch 
I'm riding around with tints and bombs in the trunk 
Chilly fresh around my neck and I'm getting so drunk 
It's six dollars to wreck it, don't get mad if your girl wanna check it 
I'm hoppin' out the jimbo and getting ready in harlem
My hood is rockin' and they call me the jewel 
If you come around, you better have an alias 
It's warrants in the hood and we watching our backs
Take caution, understood, don't get no slacks

I crawl into the darkness, darkness of my mind
A deep slumber, the demon of the night takin' over me
Voices call me, faces appearin' out of thin air
Takin' over my body, I'm fallin' to despair

There was no escape, I was chained to the ground
My reality had flipped, what was I gonna do now?
No way out now, I'm losin' control
I'm feelin' like I'm livin' in an eternal hole

My faith was lost, could I save the life of this unborn child?
I'm searchin' for redemption, will I be reborn one day?
My heart was breakin', I had to make a change
To keep my little one alive, and to keep her from the grave

To change the face of my life with your future in mind
Time to do what was right, a new beginning I could find
When I saw that heartbeat, I knew that it was not a sin
I set myself free, and know that now I could begin

My child, my child, I hope that you were redeemed
Strugglin' through the darkness, I've now seen the light it seemed
I'm a warrior, I'm breakin' all my chains
I'll fight for you, until there's ain't no life left in my veins

My child, my child, no longer will I be denied
Freed from the pain, I now know that I have survived
I'm reborn, I'm still livin', I'm no longer in the dark
My redemption, my one chance to show this world I'm a spark",rap
" 

Can't believe what I'm feeling, I thought that I was dreaming
Life was so appealing before the day you left me grieving
A vacant hole within my heart where divine love was discovered
A void so deep, no words can explain the pain I uncovered

When the sorrow and the grief had conquered all hope in sight
I knew the only way was to fight and make it through the night
Reaching for the stars, reaching for the strength to let you go
Knowing that you're in a better place, that's the only thing I know

To change the face of my life with your future in mind
Time to do what was right a new beginning I will find
When I saw that heartbeat, I knew it wasn't a sin
Can someone tell me why this has happened to me?

Why was it only in death were you redeemed my child
This world was never fair, its one thing I know
Realizing what I lost when the reaper came to take you home
No serenity within, every day a hundred ways to fight
Resurrecting all the demons, yet your spirit still alive

My one desire, to trade my soul for yours
Grief crippled me, the reaper cheated me
Left me yearning for the path I'd come to adore
Praying for the day, my baby you'd be restored

To change the face of my life with your future in mind
Time to do what was right a new beginning I will find
When I saw that heartbeat, I knew it wasn't a sin
Can someone tell me why this has happened to me?

Why was it only in death were you redeemed my child
The broken pieces of my heart that laid scattered and bare
The cries of anguish and despair echoing through the air
The hands of fate had robbed me blind, this is what I feared
For one last time, my baby I held, I ain't never shed a tear

To change the face of my life with your future in mind
Time to do what was right a new beginning I will find
When I saw that heartbeat, I knew it wasn't a sin
Can someone tell me why this has happened to me?

Why was it only in death were you redeemed my child
My child, can someone tell me why?
Why was it only in death were you redeemed my child",rap

Verse 1
Livin' with the guilt, consumed by regret,
The way I treated you, I'll never forget,
It's like a virus, livin' inside of me,
And now I'm seein' the wrong I've done with clarity.

Chorus
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold,
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold.

Verse 2
Misguided thoughts, blinded by pride,
It's time I accept that I can't hide,
And now I'm seein' the truth in your eyes,
That showed me the love I never realized.

Chorus
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold,
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold.

Verse 3
Takes two to heal, builds something pure,
To build the strength, takes somethin' more,
Its never easy, but we'll start anew,
It's all worth it, to find peace with you.

Chorus
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold,

Verse 1:
Looking back at me, I see I never did it right,
I never stopped to think of you, I'd always get it wrong in sight.
Your heart was like an antidote, it got me through the night,
Like a drug that soothed my soul and put me in the spotlight.

Chorus:
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
Never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold,
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
Never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold.

Verse 2:
It's all the lies that made you go, and casted me aside,
Maybe in a different light, you can see me stand up with pride,
Cause now I see what you mean, the antidote as clear as day,
Something strong like a drug that takes me far away. 

Chorus:
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
Never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold,
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
Never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold.

Verse 3:
I wish you'd never seen the darkness, the screwed up side of me,
It's something I keep locked away, I hope you still believe,
That I never really wanted you to go, I'm sorry you must know,
I guess for me there's just no hope, I never meant to be so cold.

Chorus:
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
Never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold,
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am,
Never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold.",rap

Working hard forever, no rest or break.

In my Bently drop top, no need for the dash.

Get the money till the break of dawn, and do it all the time.

Put it in the bank, cause money is the mission,
Keep it coming 'til I'm living off investments.

Gettin' paid before the sun comes up, never stop the profits.

Verse One
I met this broad, said her name is Misty
She used to be a stripper but she tryin' to get free
She said the hustle's hard, she tryin' to stay out it
But she still on the grind tryna pay the rent
I told her that's how it goes in the hood
Tryin' to make it rain but your goals ain't no good
She said she ain't doin' this no more, this ain't the life she chose
She wants a real love, not just a one-night show

Chorus
I know she's a freak, I know she's freaky
I know she's a freak, super freak
Please don't try to run game on me, I'm not a playstation
Please don't try to run game on me, I'm not a 360
She said she don't wanna be a freak no more, she don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more, don't wanna be freaky no more

Verse Two
I seen a single mother tryna make it work
She had a baby young, no father to the child
She tryin' to make ends meet just to stay afloat
Before I knew it, I had her in my vote
I said don't worry 'bout a thing, everything will be just fine
But when I looked in her eyes, she had tears in her eyes
She was too proud to ask, so I asked her what's up
She said she got a job that she can't get enough

Chorus
I know she's a freak, I know she's freaky
I know she's a freak, super freak
Please don't try to run game on me, I'm not a playstation
Please don't try to run game on me, I'm not a 360
She said she don't wanna be a freak no more, she don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more, don't wanna be freaky no more

Verse Three
My girl said that I'm too wild for her love
But in my heart I want her, I'm just not giving up
She said I'm too young, she said I'm too old
She said I'm too broke, she said I'm too bold
But I just can't give up, I'm gonna keep trying
'Cause I know she's the one, and one day she'll be mine
So I'm gonna keep being me and living life
Just gonna keep grinding, gonna be alright

Chorus
I know she's a freak, I know she's freaky
I know she's a freak, super freak
Please don't try to run game on me, I'm not a playstation
Please don't try to run game on me, I'm not a 360
She said she don't wanna be a freak no more, she don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more, don't wanna be freaky no more",rap

I hit the club, looking for a new one,
I seen this chick, with a body like a drum, 
She got me hooked, with her eyes and her curves, 
She said she ain't trying no more to be a fly girl

She don't wanna be a freak no more, 
She don't wanna take Molly, get peeked no more, 
She don't even wanna strip no more,
She don't wanna see the pole, 'cause young nigga walking straight in with the gold.

I asked her why, to my surprise, 
She said she got a kid and she want to be wise,
Daddy out of the picture and she said she gonna change,
She said she was looking for someone to take the blame

She don't wanna be a freak no more, 
She don't wanna take Molly, get peeked no more, 
She don't even wanna strip no more,
She don't wanna see the pole, 'cause young nigga walking straight in with the gold.

She said she wanted to have a real life, 
She said she wanted to have a husband and a wife, 
I said, ""Ain't no way, I'm too young for that,""
She said, ""I don't care, I just want a real family.""

She don't wanna be a freak no more, 
She don't wanna take Molly, get peeked no more, 
She don't even wanna strip no more,
She don't wanna see the pole, 'cause young nigga walking straight in with the gold.

I said, ""Make the move and forget the world, 
The life we live ain't for no young girl, 
Risking her life, this ain't no game,
Turning tricks, living life in shame."" 

She don't wanna be a freak no more, 
She don't wanna take Molly, get peeked no more, 
She don't even wanna strip no more,
She don't wanna see the pole, 'cause young nigga walking straight in with the gold.",rap

Hit up the liquor store coz it’s all going down 
Ate something I shouldn’t a should’ve just sticked to the ground 
Swigging back shots of liquor I'm no longer sober

Drinking back all the whiskey I'm in this to win or bust

Sippin on like I got no frets at all

My mouthpiece is gold and I know you can't ignore

Get money, stack it up, my jewelry won't stop 
Gold, spinnaz and diamonds, you know my style won't drop

My ice will keep you warm, if you stay near the liars 
Dropping bars, I'm taking it to the top of the game 
Real recognize real, and they know I'm doing my thang

You can see my swag in the dark, it's like a million lights 

So, if you wanna be the best, get your ice and stack it up
Rock it on the block, get your hustle up, show em what you got
Get money and stay fly, let your jewelry speak
The iced out life's what I'm living, can't take away my dreams

Got a chain game so strong,

Maybe I'ma stunt, maybe I'ma stop,
Maybe I'ma shine, 'cause I got a watch,
And show off my jewelry, and what it cost,

Burnin' through the speaker's system, livin' off the vibe we gettin'
Money talks and politicians tote the 45
Sippin' on the Bacardi, gettin' lit from the moon to the sun
Gotta check the rearview mirror, keep that Colt at ease
Cause the law always watchin' us and they can never give us peace

We gettin' drunk and high, livin' life on the fly
Gonna do it up 'til we all pass out, singin' in the night
We don't care what the haters say, no matter who's right or wrong
Just pour a shot for me and one for the homies, and put that Colt on song
So, put your hands up and let the party never end
We screamin' from the hills, gettin' drunk and smokin' again
Throwin' down, club party, and we don't care 'bout nothin'
We just lookin' for a good time, let's toast to freedom, Colt Forty Fiva!",rap

Bumpin my music, set the vibes, I'm a king

Livin my life cuz I'm livin life smart

Ima stay up late and hit the town
Gonna get crunk, show em how its done
Grab a beer, grab a loyalty

Smoke a blunt, take a shot
Time to get low, and that's a fact
Ain't no stopping us, livin life to the fullest

Can't nobody run up and try to hold me down

I'm the hottest in the town, the boys better bow down

Sweat pumpin' in my eyes, vision a blur
But even though my eyes are closed, I see visions of her

No reason for security, I'm feeling secure
You guarding my body, baby, come on and gimme some more
If all these people wasn't in here flockin' around
And how you in the middle of the floor, baby knockin' you down
The dude who be talkin' bout when I walk in the house

A damn shame how you do the damn thang
Girl, you off the damn chain, but you 'bout to be tamed

Chorus
Look at you laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin'
It wasn't my intention, but you got me cringin'
My linen come on, call me a doctor give me a respirator
Look into my eyes, mama, pressure is rapidly rising
All around my naked leg, all around my thigh
Feels like ecstasy when you next to me, getting me high
Girl, you dancin' honey, that's how I like to play

High heels, stiletto, sexy straight out the ghetto

My flow is so tight that nobody in this town can match me
Got these haters shook up, mad cuz I'm fly as a canary
Living life on my terms, it's all about stacking this money
It ain't so long in the past, I was so broke and hungry
Now I'm sipping champagne, got respect and it's funny
Cuz these same folks use to say I'm nothin' but a dummy
They hate me cause I'm winnin' and aint no way to stop me
Every night they go to sleep, I'm still grindin' and rockin'
Don't try to fuck with me, cuz you know where I'm headed
These negative thoughts can't slow me, I'm too blessed and too blessed
I'm sorry that I'm making waves and disrupting the status quo
I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today
Aint nobody fuckin' with me cuz they know my team is strong
Can't squad with us, I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today

My rhymes so raw that the streets are feeling my sound
My pockets are deep and I'm giving out trees in town
My beats so hard, rocks the walls and the ground
My words stimulate so don't try to mess around
My style is so unique, nobody can come close
Really got the people watching how I flow and how I ghost
My ambition's high, it's too late for the foes
Cause I'm makin' moves and I'm rockin' shows
They hate me cause I'm on top, but I stay lowkey
I'm livin' life for the moment and I'm blessed with the breeze
I'm sorry that I'm making waves and disrupting the status quo
I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me cuz they know my team is strong
Can't squad with us, I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today

My skills are so hot and my swag is never ever changin'
I'm rollin' with the heat and my heat is never fadin'
My work ethic is strong and I'm never shying away
My life so dope, I'm bout to blow up like a big bomb bay
My dreams so vivid, I'm livin' a beautiful fate
I'm blessed with so much, don't think I can ever hate
My lyrics so fire, nobody can ever relate
I'm sorry that I'm making waves and disrupting the status quo
I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today
Aint nobody fuckin' with me cuz they know my team is strong
Can't squad with us, I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today",rap

Can't stop, won't stop, Young Gunnz and Chingy
That's right, we'll take it to the next level
Neef and Chris getting cash, they make the ladies jel
We got the four four, they can't ignore
We pop the Cris', rock the foreign cars
Put the money in the bag and make it rain on the bars
We got the swag y'all, can't deny it
The ladies screaming Young Gunnz when we step in the building
Chingy got the girls that go crazy for the hoes
Neef and Chris playing by the code
We never break the rules, always do the moves
Forever cool, never getting caught up in the blues
So get up, get down and rock the house
We light up the night when we step out
Using all the style that we can muster
Show 'em how we do it, Young Gunnz plus Ching-duster
Can't stop, won't stop, Chingy and the Gunnz
Cause we get down, baby, we get down
The girls, the girls, they love us
We run it up and make it a remix
Next generation, better stay focused
Young'uns before they time out, you already know this
Ball 'em never call 'em, kick 'em out before their moment
It seems like once you done, they start drawlin'
You never have 'em, so you cuff 'em, when you grab 'em
I treat 'em all the same, even the bad ones
Gold magnum, rose gold, chains for show
Aim four four magnum, and let 'em know
When they done, better blast 'em
I'm laid back, smoking bags and playing Madden
You know we tap 'em middle room, backroom, living room, bathroom
Sit at home and cap 'em, you got it, it's nothin'
I had 'em, you can have 'em, C and Neef we the streets
Gunnaz be the last one
Can't stop, won't stop, Chingy and the Gunnz
Cause we get down, baby, we get down
The girls, the girls, they love us
Can't stop, won't stop, Chingy and the Gunnz
Cause we get down, baby, we get down
The girls, the girls, they love us
Man I can't stop, won't stop, girl quit actin like ya can't pop
Won't drop to the flo, I move crowds like I moved hop
Man 94 on the block, handful on my jock
You wanna know it's official when I step up in it
You wanna party, lemme get the YG's, and we'll be therr in a minute
Maybe chicken head with it, I'm in the authentic
Get it boy, jersey G, I be hat fitted
Run it, tell the world we did it, got the boxed up benz range
And got both 'em kitted, Ching Aling world wide
Girl player, and I'm pimpin'
You never seen my thurral side, the girls, the girls, they love me
You know I stay fresh till death, like Doug-E
I step in the spot, these cats they mug me
Got drank in row, so meet me at the club
Neefy and Chris, we can game any chick
One had to pay a dime, pay no mind, it's quite absurd
Just sayin' the right words, I like nice hair, titties and nice curves
Givin' neck doses, smoking on a bag, fa sho

Been around the world, seen it all, and still got more
Gotta keep it true to the game, cuz forever its ours
Women see the swagger and check how we do
Spittin lyrics that won't quit, no one's stoppin us two

Gunnaz they the realest, hit the track with the freshest
Setting trends that can't be broken, no matter how they try it
Got em lookin at us, even when we go out to eat
Doing it with class, that's how we make our many feats
So let it bang and let them know, why they should know our name
Gunnaz and Chingy, bringing the same flame
That's why they love us, that's why they wanna come and stay
That's why I do what I do, cuz I love it this way

I was livin' life to the max and I felt so alive
Til I crashed and burned, only I stayed alive
My thoughts swirling, my mind going round and round
My body high but I still felt down

Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God
Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God

I'm feeling unhappy, can't help but ask why
I take what I can but then I just say goodbye
I keep it all inside, I just don't know what's right
I can't seem to break away, no end in sight

Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God
Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God

I heard a voice it said I must be brave
Step out of my shadow, I must be brave
It's a hard road, but I feel it's worth it
Take a step and don't look back, I'm done with it

Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God
Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God

Ain't gonna stop, I keep on fightin'
My true colors I'm showin', I'm steppin' out and
Sayin' my truth and I'm lettin' go
Ain't afraid to be broken, I will not fall

Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God
Cause it's the way I think mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way I are, float up 'til I'm close to God",rap

Verse 1

So we been livin' in Vegas, tryna get away from this drama and hate,
Ain't no one knowin' what's gonna be our fate -
and the thought that our love could save us somehow had me hopin' fate
But then everything flipped, suddenly it ain't even safe.

Chorus

If you go home then you'll be gone forever,
You said I'd be anything I ever wanted to be better.
If you go home then yeah you'll be lost forever.
Stay another night with me and pretend we are together,
Pretend we are together, pretend we are together.

Verse 2

Everywhere I go seems like the same shit,
All these people here only out for their own benefit,
And I know for sure it's contagious, but I'm not scared -
I'm just tryin' to keep my head above the trade.

Chorus

If you go home then you'll be gone forever,
You said I'd be anything I ever wanted to be better.
If you go home then yeah you'll be lost forever.
Stay another night with me and pretend we are together,
Pretend we are together, pretend we are together.

Verse 3

Hey! I'm tryin' to stay above the mess,
Find the courage to tell you how I really feel I guess,
Listen up, 'cause now it's time for me to say
That I don't think I can keep living this way.

Chorus

If you go home then you'll be gone forever,
You said I'd be anything I ever wanted to be better.
If you go home then yeah you'll be lost forever.
Stay another night with me and pretend we are together,
Pretend we are together, pretend we are together.",rap
"

Verse 1:
Tryna break away from this small town life and livin in Vegas, this love should have saved us but you made the change.
I'm afraid the influence is contagious, I can't understand why you stay the same.
High enough, you'd experience being all alone, but I'm no astronaut so I can't fake this.
Time to take all my things and meet where we first started, I'm sure you got problems, everybody got them.

Chorus:
If you go home then you'll be gone forever,
You said I could be anything I wanted to be better.
If you go home then you'll be lost forever,
Stay another night with me and pretend we are together,
Pretend we are together,
Pretend we are together.

Verse 2:
Left it all behind to find a better view, trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do.
People got agenda, they try to bring you down, my heart is still broken, livin in fantasy.
Tattoos can't cover up my personality, thought I'd be enough but it's not what it used to be.
Insecurity got me on a permanent vacation in these bars, those stars used to bring us together but can't be found.

Chorus:
If you go home then you'll be gone forever,
You said I could be anything I wanted to be better.
If you go home then you'll be lost forever,

We can take it slow, be feeling wild
Or crank it up, if you got a little style
Ain't like anything you ever seen before
Gonna beat the odds, suggest you open up the door
Whatever we do keep it between us two
And when we're done, we're gonna break away, me and you
So no more time to waste, it's time to make a move
Gonna blow your mind, can't be nothing left to lose

I said don't you act like that just let your freak out

I'm feeling kinda lonely no substitute for the one I love
Still I stay reminiscin' 'bout the way we used ta do
It's raining in the city and it's washing away my blues
Cause I only think about you when it starts to pour

It's been a long time comin' and I just can't bear the news
I'm losing every battle like a soldier on the frontlines
I'm so scared to let you go but still I keep holding on
Cause I only think about you when the skies start to moan

My heart keeps aching for another shot at love again
Don't let the rain fall and take away this dream
Cause I only think about you when I'm drenched in the stream

My memories haunt me and I'm missing your embrace

Better watch out, got a full clip, finna attack
Cause I'm a gangsta and I'm here to reclaim my throne
Droppin' rounds like rain while I'm speaking through my chrome
There's no escape, on a mission to kill the peace
Burn the house down with a lyrical heat
From the streets came the dope and the propers
I'm the king of da hood, gettin' money like a vulture
I been around, been puttin' in work
Times when my homies couldn't take it no more, and had to hold up a hearse
I'm wired up, aimin' for the stars
Murder on my enemies, I'm about to watch you niggas fall apart
You think I'm playing, but I'm serious with it
My glock cocked, can't nobody touch me with it
Don't make me buck you down, I'm here with something to prove
They already know that I'm the king, so there ain't nothing to lose
Riding 4 4, no chillin' with jakes
Everybody know I'm a real killa, but I also bless beats
So if you want beef, I'ma bring it to you
Feel the pain as I'm blazing domes, cause I won't hold back my crew
I'm a og guerrilla and I'm taking no losses
Cause when I get wired up, niggas get laid to the cross
I'm about to prove why I'm the best
Murder on my enemies and leave them with nothing less
Got the east side on keep on watchin' me
Catch em one by one and empty out my clip, leaving nothing but yellow tape
It's the truth, don't mess with the squad
Cause when it comes to Z-RO, it's reprocussions when you niggas press my buttons too hard",rap
"

Some people call me the demon cause i leave you cold,
Leave niggas trembling in fear like they need a soul.
I tried to be the bigger man, but my plan took a blow,
Haters forced me to swing back and to let my anger show.

So get ready for the fall, you niggas done stepped in it,
Don't worry 'bout me cause I'm coming back with a hit.
I heard the whispers for myself, I'm back and let it be known,
Got a whole army behind me ready to make a home.

Fuck with me, I'm bringing a whole war to your door,
I'm the one they call when they need some business done swift and sure,
Got something to prove, gonna bring the heat when I roll,
So brace yourself, this time I'm in control.

Love nothing and hate something, every breath I take
I'm gonna make sure niggas see a body when I shake,
Put you in a relationship with a four-four and a clip,
My word is my bond, so don't ever try to flip.

If y'all fellas wanna play games, I'm dumping on every car I see.
It's that time when I play, mayn brace yourself, 'cause I'm gonna repel,
Got the power to bring the devil out of any man I meet,
And I'm ready for war so if you come at me, get ready for defeat.

If you wasn't on keep on watching, you ain't no guerilla,
Trying to imitate a gangsta, that's when a gangsta come get ya,
Run and tellin' toy soldiers in your crew, the war's on,
Catch 'em one by one and dump my gun and cease to keep on.",rap

Verse 1
I heard it bumpin, never stoppin, people jumpin on the floor
This ain't no doubt that the West Coast is in yo mouth
It's all gravy, petty cash but I'm never lazy
Block hugger, the hood raised me, can't keep me down no way
I'm a hustler gettin cash like crazy, steppin up my game
From ear to my pinkie ring, I'ma spark like a king
A whole lot of haters try to shake me, I just tap 'em on the shoulder
My name's poppin 'bout like a street pin, bling bling ain't nothin to me

Chorus
I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes
Try to bring me down, but I'm too high, livin like a G
I'm so intrigued and I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes
Never trippin 'cause it ain't nothin to me, but I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes (Hah hah hah!)

Verse 2
My local cats can't keep up with me, no names mentioned but I know it's felt
From the Wood, they ain't ready, I'm a headliner and they just spectatin'
For life, I make the classic sounds, don't forget who was payin yo bills
Introducin you to the game and givin you deals, livin good independently rhymin'
You got the hustle game backwards, nickel and dinin'
My hip hop classics make 'em drop, yo group ain't been heard of past the bottom
Get wild, I can't go to my turf and mingle with my Gs
One word: What? Chickenhawks ain't worth a feather in my wing

Chorus
I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes
Try to bring me down, but I'm too high, livin like a G
I'm so intrigued and I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes
Never trippin 'cause it ain't nothin to me, but I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes (Hah hah hah!)

Verse 3
Got ways like a dame, how lame you actin
Like a groupie around famous cats and it's strange
You don't have no shame in that, got yo card,
Playboy but I ain't trippin', just roll with the punches and keep it pimpin
Got dough by bunches, donatin and tippin,
Throw dubs up high, Westside for life
Y'all hate me, but that's just what it is
Take a picture, trick, it might make ya rich

Chorus
I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes
Try to bring me down, but I'm too high, livin like a G
I'm so intrigued and I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes
Never trippin 'cause it ain't nothin to me, but I can still see the hate in yo eyes, hate in yo eyes (Hah hah hah!)
 Outro
Mack one, oh, hoo bangin' for life and it don't quit
Take a picture, trick, yeah, take a picture trick, yeah,
It might make ya rich, Westside riders, ba-bay, uh uh uh uh uh uh, uh",rap
"

Yeah, my flow is strong, my lyrics like a G
I can put a show on, just a simple B
I'm gonna do it all like an OG
Since the beat dropped it's time for me to flow free
I'm on the street, lights shine bright around me
From the hood, making it to the top of the key
I cut the beef and I rise up, I got what it takes
So I'mma keep the fire on and let it break

Money and fame, living the high life
Diamonds on my neck, and my car's on cruise
My beats go hard, and I'm ready to rock
Flow like a champion, and I'm never gonna stop

My crew's out here nowadays, shout out to my band
Go hard in the paint, just know that we can
Hit the stage and I know they'll be singing my songs
South side of town and you can hear it all night long

Fuck all the haters, I'ma do me
Don't let em bring me down 'cause I'm the king of the street
So I'mma keep it real and stay true
This is the life I choose, this is what I'mma do

No time for games, keep my head held high
Gotta keep hustling, no matter what try
Catch me in the spot, rockin the mic
Don't try to step to me 'cause my flow is tight

Yeah, I'm the king of the block, and the party's on
So if you try to come at me with a beef, you better be long gone
No need for stress, I'm out here with my squad
Rippin it up, keepin it lowkey, no one can outflank us

This is the life that I'm living and it's going great
Stay real to yourself and never hesitate
Put it on for the hood, and never forget that
Put down the bull and just let the rap do the rest",rap

Verse 1
I brought you into this world, I can take you out
You’re so lazy, always on that couch
Let me tell you something now, I’m not a maid to you
You’re selfish, never want to do a thing
I tell you to clean the house, and you do the opposite
You always want money, but you don’t work at all
When it comes to your grades, why don’t you try hard
You need to stop taking selfies, this isn’t healthy
And focus on getting good grades, or else you’ll be in misery

Chorus
Not listening to what mom said
Refusing to do chores instead
Always on the phone, never in the know
Start taking it seriously and try to grow

Verse 2
Time to pay attention, no more skipping class
No use in complaining, no mommy can’t pass
You need to start taking this seriously now
Or else you’ll be stuck in a dead-end job anyhow
Go clean the room, don’t be griping and snaring
Don’t act so grown if you can’t even finish a task
Can’t even take the time to answer one calc question
How are you gonna get a job and pension

Chorus
Not listening to what mom said
Refusing to do chores instead
Always on the phone, never in the know
Start taking it seriously and try to grow

Verse 3
You’re not driving my car, even if you had your test
I’m tired of you not listening to me, it’s getting old and not the best
You drive like you want to die, now calm down or else I’ll freak
Don’t talk to me while I’m driving, I’m not your puppet that you can speak
My house is looking like a forest, it’s your job to take care
Clean the trash, stop taking selfies, and show mom you actually care
If you can’t show her gratitude, then your grandma won’t be proud
You should be cleaning my house, instead of hanging ‘round

Chorus
Not listening to what mom said
Refusing to do chores instead
Always on the phone, never in the know
Start taking it seriously and try to grow",rap

Verse 1:
I'm the one who's never getting anything done 
Standing in the corner when it's time to take some
You say I'm lazy and always on the couch 
But this too shall pass and I ain't gonna pout

Chorus:
You never do anything around this house
Better wash those dishes better watch that mouth 
Getting those grades up is what you're 'bout to do 
Okay mom boy don't get an attitude

Verse 2:
I'm always asking for some cash and if I'm late I catch an attitude 
My grades ain't no 'A's and I'm getting in a bad mood 
I don't wanna clear the mess I never said I'd do 
You say it's my job and I don't have a clue

Chorus:
You never do anything around this house 
Better wash those dishes better watch that mouth 
Getting those grades up is what you're 'bout to do 
Okay mom boy don't get an attitude

Verse 3:
I'm focused on girls, can't focus on my tasks 
My grandma is coming so I gotta clean this mess 
My mom gives me orders and I'm about to go mad 
'Cause she wants this done but I don't have a plan 

Chorus:
You never do anything around this house 
Better wash those dishes better watch that mouth 
Getting those grades up is what you're 'bout to do 
Okay mom boy don't get an attitude

Verse 4:
I better listen up cause she's not playing around 
I can't even clean one room without making a sound 
I'm trying to graduate and get a job and pension 
Mom said I gotta do it, no more procrastination 

Chorus:
You never do anything around this house 
Better wash those dishes better watch that mouth 
Getting those grades up is what you're 'bout to do 
Okay mom boy don't get an attitude",rap

I woke up so fresh and caught that buzz
Feelin' like I'm ready to take on life without any fuss
Gonna move forward and never look back
Cause I'm with my squad and we're ready to attack
Letting the haters trying to bring us down
My city's been waiting for me to break the crown
I don't care what they say cause I'm moving forward
My skills and style got me up and going on the ward
Gonna look down the road, make the most of it
My way of living, like a bugatti with a priceless fit
Ain't got no worries, no pain in my life
Just wanna be on the grind and make it good for the wife
Ain't scared of failure cursed by the world
Gonna keep pushing forward, my wings are unfurled
My songs are gonna make your head bop
My game is gonna get on top
Rhymes goin' smooth like home-brewed coffee
Grabbin' the mic and this rap gonna last more than a week
Mama been watchin' me since day one
Gotta make her proud and show everybody I'm number one
Auntie was a player and my Uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego
Auntie was a player and my Uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego
So I'm gonna keep pushing forward, never look back
The only way to get through any hurdle is to attack
I'm in it for the love and I'll never quit
Gonna keep livin' this rap life, it's my mission that I won't forget
I'm gonna succeed, no excuses or a lie
My words gonna move mountains, my vision can't deny
My raps are like missiles, steadily launchin'
My hustle will forever keep my fans clappin'
My style is like the wind, it'll never go stale
It's the truth, you can feel it in my flow, you can hear it in my tales
Auntie was a player and my Uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego
Auntie was a player and my Uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego
My flow is gonna hit, give you a shock
Livin' this rap life like it's going out of stock
Forget the fame and the glory, I keep it real
Ain't about the money, but I need it for a meal
My rhymes steep, like some aged wine
Got respect for everybody, and it ain't no crime
Cause I'm a wordsmith who don't play around
I'm gonna take it to the top, no bound
Auntie was a player and my Uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego
Auntie was a player and my Uncle was a preacher
Sipping on a bottle about the size of your ego",rap

Verse 1:
I'm talking 'bout you boys, all up in the hood, 
Think you on a throne, but you better understood,
you got nothing to show, but your b-boy attitude
You act like a king, but you're acting real rude

Chorus:
Oh, you motherfuckers think that you got it all
But I'm the one that's here, to make ya fall
You took this too far, you got too cocky
It's time to turn the tables, now show me what you got me

Verse 2:
Rolling with the crew, acting like you tough,
But I'm not impressed, by none of your bluff,
You think you own the world, but you don't know enough
To keep your mouth shut, and do the right stuff

Oh, you motherfuckers think that you got it all
But I'm the one that's here, to make ya fall

Once the love was strong, it just wasn't meant to last
Now the pain of a broken heart is here and it's a blast
I'll keep on holding on, 'cause I need you by my side
'Cause in your eyes I can see my future and she's so bright

The memories keep on coming, they never go away
Reminding me of when we used to laugh and play
It seems like it was just yesterday, so hard to accept
That the future we planned together has gone in a blink

Chorus: 
Cause I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I think about you every day, every hour, every minute, every second
I can't deny it, I still need it, I just want you by my side
I'll never ever try to hide it, I just want you in my life

It's like a broken dream, it just doesn't make sense
On my own I can feel my hope slowly slipping away
Without you here, I've been in an eternal daze
And each breath that I take, it gets harder and harder to stay

I search the sky, but your love isn't there
And all the time we used to share has disappeared in the air
Out of every love I've ever known, you're still the one that stands out
You were the woman of my dreams, and I can't help but shout

Chorus: 
Cause I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I think about you every day, every hour, every minute, every second
I can't deny it, I still need it, I just want you by my side
I'll never ever try to hide it, I just want you in my life

Verse 2: 
All of those days we used to talk and make new plans
Risky moves and heartbreaks, I still feel it in my hands
I know you never wanted to give it all up, that's why it hurts
But none of us can stop the turn of fate and what it really works

We shared a strong connection that's so hard to explain
And if we're ever gonna make it back, it'll be down a long, long lane
Life sets it's own expectations, it just keeps on rolling
But I'm here in my world and I'm still slowly waiting for you 

Chorus: 
Cause I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I think about you every day, every hour, every minute, every second
I can't deny it, I still need it, I just want you by my side
I'll never ever try to hide it, I just want you in my life.",rap

Verse 1:
It's all gone, it's all through, the damage is done and all I have is lost
I take this stress and I make it real, loaded gun and can't cross these lines
But I thought we could all coexist and sing a song of peace
But this life ain't what I expected, I'm struggling with the pain inside

Chorus:
And by the time you hear this I'll be gone
By the time you hear this I'll be gone
Buried alive, knew too much of danger, every word I spoke was unheard
So I try to search for a better life, but it's too late to make up for lost time
And by the time you hear this I'll be gone

Verse 2:
Sinking deep in this state of mind, flowing through these rivers of time
Got no control, just a puppet to life, always changing and never what I wanted
I search for answers, speak life to dead stones, just to break the myth of a good life
Maybe somebody up there knew, even in death the truth's still true

Chorus:
And by the time you hear this I'll be gone
By the time you hear this I'll be gone
Buried alive, knew too much of danger, every word I spoke was unheard
So I try to search for a better life, but it's too late to make up for lost time
And by the time you hear this I'll be gone

Verse 3:
Can you feel me, can you hear me, calling out to the night sky
Design a better world, see the pictures in your mind, a little bit of peace is what I'm trying to find
Dreams become fantasies, lifes a mystery, I'm watching killers die, still trying to figure why
But I'm still here, still alive and fighting, searching for a way out, a way to get away
My thoughts still alive and breathing, creating stories and songs, just to get me free

Chorus:
And by the time you hear this I'll be gone
By the time you hear this I'll be gone
Buried alive, knew too much of danger, every word I spoke was unheard
So I try to search for a better life, but it's too late to make up for lost time
And by the time you hear this I'll be gone",rap

Verse 1:
I'm going out with a bang, my spirit's left this plane,
The only thing I'm leaving is this rap to explain
The little faith I had is gone, I can't take this pain
I tried to move past it but it came right back again
And so I loaded my gun and bandaged up the sun
And I got lines that I can't cross, that can't be undone
My father said I'm better off, but I'm still in the dark
Feeling like I'm on a job that just can't be marked

Chorus:
By the time you hear this, I'll be gone,
Bury me in darkness, I knew too much
A danger every time I speak, no one hears
My advice, it goes unheard, I'm less than a peep
By the time you hear this, I'll be gone

Verse 2:
Past lives on film slides, tucked deep in my rhymes
Syphoning up rocks, and then I croak
My mind is in a dark place, I'm still searching for the light
Trying to make this good life, more than just a myth tonight
And so I'm running from the sun, making moves like a vampire
High off the taste of the last bite, I'm a creature of desire
I'm hoping that someone up there knew, the truth I'm trying to show,
But by the time they hear this, I'll be gone, I have no place to go.

Chorus:
By the time you hear this, I'll be gone,
Bury me in darkness, I knew too much
A danger every time I speak, no one hears
My advice, it goes unheard, I'm less than a peep
By the time you hear this, I'll be gone",rap

Chorus: 
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray 
I could see my whole life fly past me 
Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy 
And will the money and fame outlast me 
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me 
I'm asking did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy 
Did I anything else you wanna know just ask me

Verse 1:
I watched a documentary about a man who had to cremate his son
He ended up turning his ashes into a diamond ring, to have some
Memories of his son every day, but he had to suffer a lot
And it turns out, he was inspired by the hip-hop
Industry, 'cause the stories of devante swing, alexander o neal and ava gardner
Bobby brown rocking with rick james, I'm always in for an enter
Prince had wanted alexander o neal to be morris day or jerome
But the brothers got indulged in tokes, snorting coke in their nose
Phyllis hyman's death was a tragedy, donny hadaway's life was out at sea
And Bobby Swayzee was like a drug, letting all his problems go away with ease

Chorus: 
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray 
I could see my whole life fly past me 
Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy 
And will the money and fame outlast me 
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me 
I'm asking did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy 
Did I anything else you wanna know just ask me

Verse 2:
I remembered during my journey, about sam cooke and womack
Trusting the wrong lady and Rufin punching Tammi Terrell
The funk brothers banging drums, alexander and coke again
This time Prince wanted him to join in and be like Morris Day or Jerome
Billy Preston trying to be cool, he did what he must
But in the end, Flo from Supreme died and Diana Ross cried in tears of dust
And what about Larry Troutman, killing his brother and then killing himself
Or the tragic death of Ennis Cosby, a mystery with no help

Chorus: 
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray 
I could see my whole life fly past me 
Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy 
And will the money and fame outlast me 
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me 
I'm asking did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy 
Did I anything else you wanna know just ask me

Verse 3:
John F Kennedy had some enemies, the stuff he did is only a mystery
Judy Campbell, walking in Gucci sandals and temptress looks
Harold Washington sabotaged and pushed down by the crooks
Bogey and Lauren Bacall, like a passage of time
Ruby and Ossie Davis got famous, but had a hard life
Hattie McDaniel got an Oscar for playing mammy in Gone With The Wind
But still wasn't even allowed to go, how can you defend
Sometimes keep it gangsta, sometimes keep it classy
But the money and fame can never last me, I have to free this place at last me
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray 
I could see my whole life fly past me 
Did I keep it gangsta",rap

Then the blunt ash falls down into the ashtray I can see my whole life fly by me Ask me did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, anything else you wanna know just ask me Tribe Called Quest sampled soul, U2 was rockin' dough Slick Rick made it known how he stayed with the ladies Luther Vandross sang about love and Barry White used to Kill it when he brought it and Michael Jackson stay Thrillin' as the blunt ash fall into the ashtray I can see my whole life fly by me Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, will the money and fame outlast me? Then the blunt ash falls down into the ashtray I can see my whole life fly by me Ask me did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, anything else you wanna know just ask me Biggie turned the game around with the Coogi down Bobby Brown, Queen Latifah, Puff Daddy had the town Run DMC stayed true to the rap Jersey gave it back LL Cool J, Rakim, KRS-One, Kool G Rap Music be a drug, sometimes it can get you strung out Wyclef and Lauryn Hill, they made us want to shout Music kept alive by the grace of God, We can see the lessons of the past in the ashtray I can see my whole life fly by me Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, will the money and fame outlast me?

A voice cryin' in the streets, tryin' to keep his sanity
I'm trapped in these chains of pain, can't find the one to set me free
I'm destitute, tryin' to make it out alive
See, it's like I ain't got a choice, but to feel the strife
Ain't nobody tryin' to help me, feelin' like I'm in the dark
I'm faceless, nameless, and feelin' hollow in my heart
Abandoned love and laid it to rest, now I'm one of the forgotten
I'm not me, feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless, so hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead, need somebody to help me survive
Can you replace this, I'm hollow, hollow, and faceless

So faceless, I'm hollow and faceless
We are the faceless, we are the nameless, we are the hopeless
Until we all have faces and can break free of these chains, we poor folk will continue to suffer
I'm not me, feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless, so hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead, need somebody to give me a chance
Can you replace this, I'm hollow, hollow, and faceless

I'm lookin' for a way to feel alive, need somebody to bring me back to life
Material things, they ain't do me no good, this darkness just seems to consume my soul
Tryin' to stay strong, but it's getting hard, tryin' to make it through this gauntlet of life
My spirit is broken, don't know what to do, need somebody to help me make it to the other side
Abandoned love and laid it to rest, now I'm one of the forgotten
I'm not me, feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless, so hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead, need somebody to help me survive
Can you replace this, I'm hollow, hollow, and faceless",rap

Verse 1
My heart is broken in two, I can't find me without you
My spirit's been searching, searching for something to fill the void
I've hit rock bottom, there's nowhere to fall
Thick darkness looms, I'm lost in it all

Chorus
We are the faceless, we are the nameless
We are the hopeless until we have faces
I'm not myself, feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless so hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead, need you to live again
Can you replace this, I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

Verse 2
My life's in shambles, I'm lost in a maze
Can't tell up from down, hoping you'll take my hand and raise
The memories that haunt me, I just can't shake
Drowning in my sorrow, no one can save

Chorus
We are the faceless, we are the nameless
We are the hopeless until we have faces
I'm not myself, feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless so hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead, need you to live again
Can you replace this, I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

Verse 3
It's like I'm in a prison I just can't escape
My soul's so empty, no one can take its place
Where did I go wrong, why did I stray
I need you here to tell me it's okay

Chorus
We are the faceless, we are the nameless
We are the hopeless until we have faces

Verse 1:
Life's a gamble, heart's in shackle so I'm dressed in clothes that make me feel secure
I'm trying hard not to distress, searchin' for the peace that's oh so pure
Cause it's OK, I don't lack ambition just like the sun rays, I'm shining with no exemption
Maybe you watch me, maybe you listen, maybe you cheer, maybe you glisten
Maybe you feel it, maybe you don't, maybe the shine won't dim your sorrow
Maybe you play, maybe you fold, baby you stay, baby go

Chorus:
And as long as the sun is rising we can get up and brighten somebody's day
Shining bright as the rays inside my soul
And as long as the sun is rising, help somebody rise and keep on shinin'

Verse 2:
I obsess over things that don't really matter but they do, the pain never fades away
I'm always looking for an answer, but there's none in a world so grey
But it's ok, yeah I'm still fighting, shaking off my chains, I keep on writing
Put on my headphones, feelin' alright, as I watch the sun set and warm my soul tonight
Maybe you feel me, maybe you won't, but I'mma be alright, because I know I'm strong
Maybe we'll stop somewhere down the road, don't let the moments pass by and just let them go

Verse 1:
Walking in the street all alone,
Feeling lonely, my troubles unknown,
Stuff in my head I can’t seem to shake,
I take a deep breath, feeling drained and drained,
Every waking minute feeling the same,
Sticking to my plan, focused on the game,
The world may look dark, skies so gray,
But if I keep up the faith, it'll be ok,

Chorus:
Cause as long as the sun is rising
We can get up and brighten somebody's day
by shinin' bright as the rays inside my soul

Verse 2:
Can't stay forever in this sad place,
Have to keep going, the sun will fill this space,
Overcome my foes, they'll never bring me down,
My future's bright, I can't let it drown,
Time to learn, to explore and grow,
Take the journey and make it a show,
Stay away from the wrong path,
Stay flexible, never lose the laugh,

Chorus:
Cause as long as the sun is rising
We can get up and brighten somebody's day
by shinin' bright as the rays inside my soul

Verse 3:
We all fall down and make mistakes,
But what matters is that you don't give up and shake,
Maybe it'll be the time you open up and spin,
Gonna make it through it, no matter what comes in,
Realize that life is short and don't take it for granted,
Love and happiness will always be there, undaunted,
Make sure to never forget your goals,
Your power and strength will never be a total loss.

Cause as long as the sun is rising
We can get up and brighten somebody's day

Verse 1
Hear my voice reverberate on the track
Bars popping like a gun and I'm back
Loud as a 112 in the hood like crack
Nothing holy preaching and I'm preaching that
City's in shock, war zone at night
No one sleeping all in their fright
Stressed out, they riding on top like a kite
They know what the news don't report and it ain't right
Gun shots, my niggas bustin' back
Protecting their turf, no time for slack
Smoke in the air, thizz taking its toll
Getting caught up, no way out of this hole

Hook
That molly got me cookin'
That Flocka got 'em zooted
That powder keep 'em movin'

Two for the bitches
Three for my niggas

Verse 2
My city's too lit, the realest hood alive
See the pack up and leave when the sirens arrive
My homies know if you actin' wild, you get five
Trust me, it ain't worth it, you'll get surprised
I'm tryna stay alive 'cuz they got me in they sights
Glock on my side, I'ma be safe in the night
Stomping through the pavement, no time to be polite
Watch me make a movie, I'ma shine the brightest
Feds crawling, gangs on the news
I'm the one on the run, I'ma get away soon
I'ma hit the road and catch a flight for the moon
Fillin' my pockets up with these bands, it's all good

Hook
That molly got me cookin'
That Flocka got 'em zooted

Verse 3
I'm with my niggas trynna stay alive
We ready to fight, no peace in the war zone
They want to end it quick, they ready with they chrome
They tryna make some changes to this fucked up home
Praying that I make it thru the night
See the problems that we got, got us feelin' so defeated
I'ma keep my head up, take what comes and keep on breathing
They got us trapped in this cycle and it's not leaving
Trynna find a way out but it's looking so bleak
Still we hold on, we'll make it one way or the other week
Gettin' money and that's a fact
Best believe it, I'ma come out on top and make 'em clap

I'mma marry money, no diamond ring, no wedding lace
And when I'm out I got the ladies feelin' amazed
When I move, my style is like a modern-day maze
I got that type of vision that make the future look bright
I keep it moving like a freight train on the night
Grind all day, stack up all my dough, on the low
No complaints, just achievement, I'mma reap what I sow
Got the cash and I'mma stack it like a tower

Cop's coming closer to a cell
Hit the cell, one way ticket to Hell
No job, no bail, no family, no meals
Institution, another brother loses appeal
From being broke to a prison tale
Screw it all, just going to prevail
Ship my music off like Amistad

Inject the body with a needle, Lord help us please
Dope dealers, get a job and stay real
Don't take the road to a cell, 'cause there you can't feel
No life, no love, just strife and strife
Niggas quick to show out over cheese and bright lights
Love to help the Devil do a deed
Rather bust off them keys, yeah, nigga birds and the beez

Birds and the beez, birds and the beez
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they all faking it
Niggas out here living foul, better yet they flagrant
Keep these niggas right up out the game, get them out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music, boy can you feel the pain
Leave this dope alone, and count my change, yeah
Q and I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business, living the limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show 'em all that you been tight then they'd ever been
It's evident that you intelligent
But you can't escape that life, no, no
For you my brother, I'd take sacrifice myself
Just to see you hold the mic, hit the stage and rock the set
But it's hard to change when you from the set
Won't you think about it, nigga, life or death
Living as a hustler, but still I'd like to hang
You by the neck, but do y'all wanna see them jets?
Runway jets to Singapore one way
Tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to God it's hard out here for a young black man to live
Do it for yourself, or do it for your kids
My nigga, don't let Michelle suffer
You can't buy her what she needs, all she needs is love
Put that shit aside, at the same time, know they got to eat
You gotta hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, keep it grinding, push the line
No AC, the block hot, keep on running
Cops say freeze, blue pill, red pill, choose now
Birds and the beez, birds and the beez
Birds and the beez, tired of the same ol' shit
Niggas they faking it, niggas out here living foul
Better yet, they flag",rap

Lyrics:
I'm a king so you know I reign supreme, 
My ambition got me winning like a team,
Teach them niggas bout respect,
They can never defeat this mental check,
My flow got them hoes showing concern, 
Sorry not sorry nothing for me to learn,
Look at my moves I make 'em go like whoa,
All I do is ball and get my dough,
I make it look easy but I'm working hard, 
Bet you won't find nothing better in ya yard,
Cruising through the city in my drop top Benz, 
I stay surrounded by my crew and my friends,
No time for games I'm living out my dreams, 
You can take the fake life go on retreat,
My swag is on a hundred thousand trillion trillion, 
I'm so popping they can't stop me from winning,
Bitches hate but I don't give a damn,
Cos I'm just doing me and it's the best thing that I can,

Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho 
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho
What it look like still don't give a fuck 
I'm gon roll my blunt hold my cup sip it up 
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho 
Get up on my level get up on my level ho

Everybody know I'm killing the game,
Livin life my way no I don't follow no lanes,
My charisma got me supercharged like lightning, 
Get up in a room my presence is inviting,
Got the energy to control a whole nation,
My words so powerful it's like sonic vibration,
All the haters got they eyes on my moves,
They hope I fall but they already know the truth,
My life is a movie with a sick ass script,
More fly than a bird so you betta respect it, 
Take my time and stay on my own line,
I'm too lit so you can't break my shine,
My style top tier like a luxury store,
Realness and truth on the floor,
Bitches hate but I don't give a damn, 
Cos I'm just doing me and it's the best thing that I can, 

Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho 
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho 
What it look like still don't give a fuck,
I'm gon roll my blunt hold my cup sip it up,
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho 
Get up on my level get up on my level ho",rap
"

Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho
Gonna do this my way, Imma show you how to roll
I'm living life, I never take no breaks
It always been me, don't matter what they say
Doing shows and counting stacks of cash and things
Swag on another level, they can't do this
My money speaks louder than words you say
Bitches hating, but I'm still getting paid
Gonna do this my way, and I'm gonna stay winning
Living life to the fullest and enjoying it
My crew around me, bout to touch the ceiling
Sipping on my cup, getting higher than the moon
My whole style is unique, man you can feel it
I'm just doing me, never gonna give in
My circle of trust ain't gonna change, not even a bit
My grind speaks for itself and ain't nobody ever gonna stop it
Bow down and step off, no disrespecting
Gonna take this game and make it my own
And all the hating that you do, I just ignore
Cos I'm living life and I ain't ever gonna change
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho
You can't see what I'm doing but I'm making moves
Gettin money, lookin fly, and feeling good
To all the people talking, I'm letting you know
I'm on my level, so back down and go low
My hustle never stops and I'm always getting dough
You can't take what I got, so it's nothing to show
Doing me, climbing up, and never gonna slow down
No matter what you say, I'm gonna do it my way
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho
Gonna do it my way, and never go back
Feeling good, looking fine, you can't compete
They can't stand me and the way that I get money
You see me and I'm stunting, always looking fly
Haters getting mad, but I ain't even try
Gettin money how I want it and living a life
Doin what I love and I'll never compromise
My style different, and I'm always getting paid
A king in my kingdom, bowing down ain't my thing
Get up on my level get up get up on my level ho",rap
"

Yeah, walking to the rhythm of my own beat
I'ma stay a step ahead of the game because I can't be beat
Maybe I'm a one of a kind, too focused to be blind
Attitude independent and my energy the type to shine
I'll never let 'em bring me down, I'm steadfast, come what may
Making moves like splashes in the sea, I'ma pave my own way
My vibe is strong, I'm confident beyond belief
Don't care what nobody say, I'm living inside my own sheets

The words I speak, the moves I make, like thunder and lightning
And I'm never giving up, standing up for what is right-ning
Like the electricity pushing, overflowing power
Gotta keep pushing forward, until the end of the hour
Living life, like it's a gift, I'm never gonna waste it
Cause every moment is precious and I'mma never replace it

Yeah, nothing is certain and the future is unknown
But I gotta keep pushing so I can make it known
Every dream that I have, I'm 'bout to take it and run
Gonna leave my mark on the world and make sure I get it done
Mentality strong and with faith I'm ready to face it
I spread my wings and leave my own trace, yeah I'm made to fly
My footsteps in the sand, this is my song, I'm gonna stay alive",rap
" got the rhythm from the sun never lose sight of my one

"

Aye aye, yea yea, I'm on the grind and I'm ready to shine 
Yea, I been up in the kitchen, cooking up this flow it's a masterpiece, knock em dead like a cheese
I'ma hit em in the head with some lyrical heat, tell em why the gang so proud and never need to retreat
Were the finest, no doubt, and the onlyones allowed to be in here, so if you come around, better be ready to bow
Got the boys in the hood, solid like a rock, no nonsense, they're in it to win it and they never stop
Its a cold winter, but still they stand up tall, always ready to go and never gonna fall
With the Js on the feet and the chains around the neck, small ass homies don't even try to test
Ain't no fear in the eyes all these hustlers show, how the game gets played and how you can make it to the top
24/7 working, no need to rest, streets got the word that these boys will never settle for less
Gotta get the money and power you can see, no need to look back when you know you on a mission to succeed
Taylor Gang to the top, and its never gon' drop, uh, yea, trying to make a couple mill, got my eyes on the bigger crib
Now its bout to go down, and you can feel the heat, woop woop, lil homies trying to talk big but its too late to retreat",rap

Verse 1:
This may be the last rhyme I write, so I'll make it right
Every word comin' straight from the heart, so I'll make it tight
If you're searchin' for the truth, don't think it'll be easy
Just know that tellin' lies will get you more than just breeze
It's time to break free, that's the only way we'll find peace
When your thoughts start to drift, look at it as a retreat

Chorus: 
Lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, yeah

Verse 2:
Ain't no needin' to pretend, cause you can't escape the pain
When life keeps throwin' punches, best you find a way to take the strain
Don't matter if you're daisy or rose, life is hard no matter the pose
Cuz at the end of the day you only got yourself, no one else knows
So if you keep strugglin', don't let no one tell you that's weak
Cause some things only be understood when you go through it and peak

Chorus: 
Lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, yeah

Outro:
This may be the last sunset I'll see, so take it in, take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe, so I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in
Lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, yeah",rap
"

Verse 1:
This may be the last sunset I'm gonna see, so I'll take it in, try to capture the scene
I know that pictures don't change just people in them do,
That's why I'm stuck rememberin' you
I used to think that life would be easy, no struggles or strife,
It's only now I realize that was a lie
You got a problem with committin' to me,
That's why I'm havin' a problem with committin' to you

Chorus:
We keep lookin' at each other like this is somethin' new,
But we've been here before, and this I'm sure,
Don't talk to me like I don't know how you feel,
Cause I used to be there with you in the beginning
Don't look away when I talk, I need to finish,
I'm tryna be honest, but you're tryna forget me
What's wrong with you, hey?

Verse 2:
I know you got too much on your plate,
But don't ever tell me to get out of the way
No more lies, I know that you're not fine,
Don't try it, I know what's going on in your mind
And this life with pain won't last forever,
We think it will, but one day we'll be eighty and older
We'll look back on our regrets and our pain,
Cause that's where we'll be goin', can't you see it plain?

Chorus:
We keep lookin' at each other like this is somethin' new,
But we've been here before, and this I'm sure,
Don't talk to me like I don't know how you feel,
Cause I used to be there with you in the beginning
Don't look away when I talk, I need to finish,
I'm tryna be honest, but you're tryna forget me
What's wrong with you, hey?

Bridge:
Time flies by but we keep trying to catch it,
It's all a game, the joy we once had is missing,
We're breathing, but we're not alive,
Bottled up inside, no one knows our strife.

Chorus:
We keep lookin' at each other like this is somethin' new,
But we've been here before, and this I'm sure,
Don't talk to me like I don't know how you feel,
Cause I used to be there with you in the beginning
Don't look away when I talk, I need to finish,
I'm tryna be honest, but you're tryna forget me
What's wrong with you, hey?

Outro:
This may be the last sunset I'm gonna see, so I'll take it in, try to capture the scene
This may be the last air that I'm gonna breathe, so I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in
We keep getting lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment,
And we get lost, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, lost in the moment, yeah",rap

Some days I’m on the top, some days I hit the low 
I done earned respect, worked for what I got 
Nobody can tell me nothing, I'm too hot

Verse 1
My heart's in a frenzy, its pace is like a race
My thoughts are like a fire, it's hard to keep them in place
I'm trying to move forward, but I feel like I'm stuck in a daze
Is it hormones, or is it just because of the phase?

My words come out all jumbled, gettin' overwhelmed by my soul
This pain's never-ending, it feels like I'm running a race
I'm searching for answers, but I'm stuck in this place

My emotions are numbing, I'm so confused, don't know what to do

Keep my head high and not slip.

I used to be a sucker and I fell for your game
What I didn't know, was you'd be the one to shame
So I'm closed off now, won't let you in my space
My heart is so full of bitterness and hate
I'm done with you and the illusion that you made
My lessons are in stone and I'm the wiser one

Verse 2:
This ain't no movie, there's no happy ending
Your lies and deceit, my soul is still mending

My heart's scarred from your lies, and here I vigil
No more time for pain and strife, time for moving on
Gonna make sure I'm smart before I trust anyone

No more games or shackles, I'm gonna be large

Out the door you should take flight, no more time to say goodnight

200 horses under the hood, soundin' like thunder
She got designer frames on, the windshield tinted
Beauty and brains with her, the most perfect invention
Her rearview mirror showin' Serena Williams' glare
Ain't no crime if she know how to take care
Cash in the glove compart and free from taxes
Low mileage on the meter, she possessed the most degrees
From spark plugs for conversations to brushless showers and wax
She was focusin' on the finish line, steerin' forward, no relax
Airbags for protection, always wearin' seat belts
Kinda like a tool, I kept her full, Super Unleaded fuel

With skirts and rims, swingin' off ropes and limbs
High beamin' temper and a low visor brim
One tooth, a beard like Lincoln, that's her man

She got an ancestor, cherokee explorer
Navigatin' the sea, sharpenin' arrows on Plymouth Rock
Commander in Chief, raisin' cattle, selling livestock
A strong king to the frontier, ridin' thoroughbreds 
His sons were Oldsmobiles, drinkin' Thunderbird
Some braggin' bout a horse pullin' a Volkswagon
They circle 'round the Monte Carlo, snakes with fangs and vipers
A gold digger for the cream, like Wells Fargo
Meetin' Cavaliers at the Outback Steakhouse
One got caught in the crossfire, bunch of mavericks, need to retire

Verse 1
From my desert to the sea, a lyrical Apollo
My rhymes unstoppable, like I'm blessed by Nimrod
My wordplay clickety-clack, like a stack of pistons
On the microphone, I'm unstoppable, like a fist of iron

Verse 2
Locked and loaded, I'm a lyrical sniper
Lighting up the track, like I'm a bar-b-que lighter
My bars are on fire, like I'm a pyromaniac
Leave you stuck in the dust, like an old-school Cadillac

Chorus
The BluePrint musty-fusty, yet still so crystal clear
My bars are non-commercial, but they flood your ear
My flows are undeniable and the beat's unstoppable
With a target on my back, still I hit the bullseye

Verse 3
My bars are on point and I'm never slackin'
I never sleep, sleep, like a hyperactive Jackin'
I rock the mic with every single track,
My rhymes won't ever slack and I never hold back

Verse 4
Bringing fire to the mic, I'm hotter than a chili pepper
Burning up the mic, like I'm fresher than a kilowatt heater
I'm leavin' emcees in the dust, like a crippled old school racer
My rhymes are never rusty, they stay ageless like a time-traveler",rap

Verse 1:
I'ma show these punks how to write in style,
My rhymes are sure to make you smile.
My technique is something you can't deny,
I'm laying down guap for miles and miles.

Delivering knowledge in every verse I write.
My vibe's insane, and my delivery too,
Making it difficult to choose who's better than who.

The non commercial set is now here.
Brought to you by the will of positive people,
KRS plus one equals slammin' and beats unquestionable.

Feel my presence, no need to resist,
My lines are sharper than a chef's knife in a fist.

My mic skills will bring you to tears.

And my rhymes are sure to make any crowd feel.

Saying it's wack would be a foolish thing.
My skills are real, I ain't on no jock,
My words cut deeper than the sharpest knife in your block.

My technique is majestically sincere,
My rap's hotter than the hottest flame so don't compare.
My flow ain't no joke, put it on the shelf,
My rhymes are sure to make you move somethin' off your shelf.

" die die 

I'm feeling like I can't be free, my pieces of crap car leaving me 
I try to make it all work, but it always ends up with me going berserk 
I dropped all my money, I'm feeling like a fool, time to make a plan that I can use
I'm gonna take the time to build a new ride, and this one will not leave me in a bind
This ain't no joke, I'm gonna work hard, no more of this car taking me off guard
We'll start with a frame, so strong it can't be broken, so I can cruise without fear of spoken
Custom paint on the hood, with a unique glow, a hydraulic system that's ready to flow
I'm gonna make it to the top, and I'm gonna show what I got, no more broken down rides that I'll be stuck in a lot
Subwoofers, rims, and a turbo boost, my car will be the one they'll all wanna see the most
I'm gonna ride it through the night and show my pride, no more of this car leaving me in tears and crying
A turbo engine so strong, it'll make my car sing, this aint no race, I just wanna make a thing
My steering wheel'll be smooth, no more lurching through the turns, with a suspension that will blow away all the yearns
Forget that piece of junk, I am taking the wheel and things are gonna start to get real
No more of this nonsense, no more looking for a fix, my car will run from the day to the end of all this
This car will be my pride and joy, I'm gonna travel highways without fear and enjoy
No more of that junk, I'm gonna move on to something that works, I'll show 'em I'ma king with no doubt
I'm gonna drive my custom ride, in joy and in bliss, like a ship on the ocean, it won't ever miss 
My car is a beauty, no more of this piece of junk, now I'm riding the streets and getting tons of funk",rap

My pen is my sword and it's aimed for the top
Don't need nobody's blessing to gain success
I'm doing it all with a plan and a vision

This life I'm living, ain't scared of no mission
My bars are a weapon, rap's my religion
They got me surrounded, but I'm still not giving
My rhymes so real, no need for pretending

My style is unique, like it's coming from a dream
My flow been the same since the age of fifteen
My bars go deep, like the Mariana Trench
Don't need the blessing of the industry in the end

I'm building an empire, start stacking up my stones
Don't move to the beat, I'm making my own
Don't care what they say, I'm putting on a show
My rhymes make them speechless, nobody knows

I'm living my life, my way, no need for competing
My lines, they stay real and keep on repeating
The fame don't matter, I'm finding my own way
Ain't nothing stopping the flow of what I say

My words are power, I'm taking over
Ain't stopping until I make my name a soldier
Ain't no one gonna take me out my zone
Cause I ain't second to none and never ever gonna be alone",rap

", the wind is blowin' me all night and day I can see the wizard down the way, I'm on cloud nine, I can't complain I'm chasin' dreams and fantasies, hopin' they'll become realities As I'm gettin close, I see a valley so low I feel a presence, I'm almost ready to go And then I feel a force, tellin' me it's time for me to arrive I'm at the palace and the door opens wide, the man in the hat says ""Hi"" He introduces himself as the wizard, and he's here to make sure I stay on track There's a map on the wall, and I can see exactly where I'm going, I'm more than ready to move forward and all of my wishes will come true I'm getting closer, and I can feel the magic inside I'm ready to take on the journey and I'm gonna make sure that I find out what I'm looking for, and I can never look back All hail to the wizard, the one who guides me To the land of the unknown, where I can find my way home",rap
" through the swamp with some frogs and some turtles and see a bright light up ahead it's the wizard of oz the wizard says, “Oh my! What have you done here? You crushed that wicked witch and saved this fair city. I am eternally grateful, now here is your reward. I'll grant you three wishes, and five for good measure.""

So I'm gonna get rich to the max, keep it on the low
Snatch up some high class cash and I'm out of the door
Gonna find the right women, diamond rings and all
Spinners on my ride, nothing but the finest clothes

Gonna build a mansion, high up on the hilltop
Bring my cousins and my friends, yeah, let's make a spot
So I'm stackin' up my money, and I'm goin' all out
Pimpin' 'til I'm poppin', livin' life without a doubt

And they say don't do it, they say ""you ain't gonna make it""
Grindin' with my dedication and I'm gonna take it
Gonna keep it real with me, not another fake hype
Ain't about the bling, about the life I wanna live

It's all about the wealth and the power that I seek
Grateful for the wizard and the things he did for me
Reachin’ for the stars, I'm livin’ life with a dream
As long as I have faith, no one can stop me from being me

Gonna take that yellow brick alleyway and head home
Bringing all my riches, time to build my own dome
It’s all about my future, I'm never lookin' back
Long live the wizard, my crew and that yellow brick track",rap

Nigga caught up in the drug game
caught in the cycle of lies and deceit
Hard for me to break away from the street
Money and drugs fill the air
gotta make the right decision, but i'm not sure where
The power of the drugs can be so strong
Makes it hard to make right decisions, even if I tried to stay long
I'm stuck in these dark alleys, arms full of white
Lost in the night with no one to fight
One wrong move and I could be gone
In this hell I'm livin' in, no one gets along

Nigga caught up in the drug game
Struggling to find away out, gave up on the dreams I once had
In this vicious cycle I'm tryin' to get out

Facing a lot of danger, but I can't stop now
I gotta make it out, break the chains that hold me down

Caught in the battle between good and bad

Bout the cost of being a king, so I stay humble in the game
My hommies told me don’t get caught up in the fame,
But my mind just work on overdrive, and I gotta reign
I’m getting filthy money, Lord please forgive me
I’m rolling at the top, so lowkey is how we’re living
My ambition getting bigger and I can’t contain it
Ball up in the sky and I keep it rising
Yeah, I’m getting what I want, stay focused on the mission 
Gotta control the money flow and keep it flowing 
No stopping, I’m getting money, when the clock is ticking
My heart’s like a river, and I gotta keep it running
Yeah, I’m going for the riches, no looking back
Hoodrich, I’m hustling, ain’t no turning back
Switching up my style, yeah I’m getting flack
My niggas stay down and never leave my side
I’m riding with my team no matter what the season
We’re taking all the risks, this cash gotta keep on coming
We’re stacking up the cream, and I ain’t done running
I’m getting filthy money, Lord please forgive me
We’re getting paper, so the hate won’t phase me
My ambition’s getting stronger and I can’t contain it
Gonna take my shine to the sun and keep it shining
Yeah, I’m getting filthy money, Lord please forgive me
My streets keep me focused, I got my own lane
That’s why I keep on grinding, catching all the gains
Gonna stay down with mine, getting all the fame
Gonna treat the dollar like it’s my real family
I’m getting filthy money, Lord please forgive me
My hommies stacking dough, no time for stressin

Found a way to keep the power, so they never take control

Ain't nothing gonna stop me when I'm on a mission
Got so much power I be feeling like I'm Zeus with the lightning
Ain't nobody ever gonna take my crown
Got a lotta friends that be clocking in and out of town
Stacking up my money like I'm writing out a check
My niggas counting stacks while they smoking on a double deck

Living my life like a movie every play

Never concerned how much money got, I'ma stay it

Two steppin' on them haters, I'm in the groove
And if you think you can come and take the crown, it's not true
There's only flossin' on the river that I'ma do

Money brown, money blue, when I'm in the room
My diamonds dancing and they glisten like a moon
My drip popping, got my pockets on lock
Step up and try me, you gon' be talking to the rocks
My style switchin' like a Rubik's cube, can't tell
Got two hands full of cash and two hearts full of hell
Hit the ground running, I never fail
Say it one time and I'mma make it real

Everyday it's something new, something different for the view
Take a bitch and make her choose, money brown and money blue
All the stores we running through, drop the top and let the roof
Look at what these numbers do, I don't give a fuck or two
Everyday it's something new, something different for the crew
Take a bitch and make her choose, money brown and money blue

Hello darkness welcome back to me,
My heart is so heavy and I'm feeling so empty,
I'm goin' through it, can't nobody seem to see,
That love was never meant to be.

How do I live without you,
How could you walk away from this?
Just walk away from this again.

You know life ain't been the same since you been away,
My broken heart can't seem to mend, no way,
Memories of us just make me wanna cry,
So why you leave, I just don't understand why.

How do I live without you,
How could you walk away from this?
Just walk away from this again,
How do I live without you,

I thought it was real, but I guess I was wrong,
I thought it would last but the pain been too long,
I'm tryin' to stay strong, but you're still on my mind,
No matter what I do my heart just ain't fine.

Verse 4

I come smooth as silk I'm the king of the groove
The way I move to the beat make the ladies move
In the club, I'm the one that they come to see
Cuz they know I'm that dude with the fly style and the smooth delivery
I swear I'm the truth, I ain't never speakin' lies
When I'm put on the mic, I'm giving 'em what they like
I don't bluff, I'm not bluffin', I'm always in the winnin'
Cuz I'm the coolest cat, always comin' in with the spin
I'm the man with the plan, but I'm all about respect
When I'm on the mic I'm givin' you the best
I'm speakin' my mind, won't ever say a word I don't mean
So you can take what I give you and stay up on your feet
I'm jazzy, fresh and fly, and a smooth operator
I'm the one that's keeping it true and I never play a faker
My style is unique, my flow is always tight
You can count on me to get the party rockin' tonight
So when the beat drops, it's time to just go and flow
I'm gonna show you what the master of the groove can do",rap

Pulse thumpin' in my chest like I'm wired to a beat

To flow so smooth, I'm hotter than a pot of chili beans

Sliding into the club, the whole place jumpin up
The ladies in the crowd callin out for the king of the cut

These rhymes so sweet, you can taste it like a tart apple glaze on top

I'm focused, I'm sharp, like a blade made of steel
These beats gonna move your feet, so come and go make it real
And if you got the rhythm, I'm the one that you need
My lyrics keep the groove, like a captain to a ship at sea

My flow's so hot that it's making the ice crack
I'm the master at the mic and I'm never gonna slack
I'm taking it back to basics, so don't try to compete
Cause when it comes to smooth, no one can compete with me

My vision getting clearer but my past never forgets

My ambition to succeed no matter what the cost
As I keep my faith and remain humble,
Sitting on this throne like it's been ordained in a rumble

Standing firm in everything I do and see

Chillin' in the hood, no one can contest

Ayy, 2 phoneshawty, ayy, yaass you know it's me

Drinkin' that Patron, I'ma keep it lit tonight
Smokin' on the OG, I'ma keep it in the light

Headin' out the country, just me and my honey

Choppin' it up in the club, got the bass loud and heavy
Gettin' lit like a lighter, we livin' life so easy
Club hopper, goin' in and out, I'ma take that throne
Don't follow me, cuz I'ma never be shown

Ain't no one hotter than me, so you better take hold
Ayy, 2 phoneshawty, ayy, I keep it moving like a train

Drinkin' on Bombay and I'ma get to the point
I'ma throw out the rules, I'ma do it my own joint
Holdin' it down and it's lookin' like I'm never gonna flop
Made a couple moves, now everybody talkin' on top

Verse 1
I seen you from across the room eyes meetin' like a boom
I swear I could feel the connection with a glance that was soon
But bae I was nervous and my nerves was like a broom
Sweeping away all the thoughts I had even if I full of gloom

Chorus
Hey stranger don't I look familiar to you?
Hey stranger, hey stranger
Don't I look familiar to you?
Or will I keep doin' that awkward thing you do?

Verse 2
Can't even deny, I've been thinking 'bout you
My heart's been on fire as I'm anticipating what I'm 'bout to do
Bae, I don't know why, but I can't hide it
Messin' with my head, but that's just how I want it

Couple goals, I want to strive, feeling like we'll never lose the fight

Verse 1:
My girl was mad when she came in late
Then I heard her words and I had to debate
We were still dreamin but now I'm feelin the cold chill
My mind is spinning, it's like my life's standing still
I had my doubts but I was hesitant, I'm starting to sweat as I look for a way out
My girl is on the verge of a blow and I just don't know what to say
Cause I'm tryin to stay real and avoid the pain

Chorus:
We got something for all of y'all, we like to play, we like to ball
This is a song for all of you, when we do our thing we got to do it true

Verse 2:
My girl was mad when she saw a number on my phone
I tried to keep my cool, I was on my own
I started to explain that it was nothing more than a friend
But she's not buying it and I can see it in her eyes
The situation's tense, I'm stuck in a bind
I try to take a step but I'm growing more blind
I'm caught up in a moment and I'm trying to be straight
But my girl won't move, she just won't budge

Chorus:
We got something for all of y'all, we like to play, we like to ball
This is a song for all of you, when we do our thing we got to do it true

Verse 3:
My girl's mad and I'm not sure what to do
I don't wanna make things worse, I just wanna make it through
I'm thinking of the time when we worked it out
Before it got to this point, I had no doubt
My girl's mad and I'm pissed off, too
But I know this ain't the end 'cause I still love you
It's like a tug of war, I'm just pulling back and forth
But the truth is I ain't gonna let this war go south

Chorus:
We got something for all of y'all, we like to play, we like to ball
This is a song for all of you, when we do our thing we got to do it true",rap

Verse 1:
I'm sittin in my spot thinkin 'bout the time when we both did wrong
It's a full moon and it's casting its light so I can hear the sound of our song
She's callin' up the one she met 4 weeks ago, thinkin' she's sweet and I'm about to let her go
I'm conscious of my lady, but I'm still feelin' moved, had mad love but I had mad doubts
We was still dreamin', but I had a little fight, 'cause I didn't even hear it when the door unlocked

Chorus:
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin' in late?
We was still dreamin' and I had a little fight
But I guess the truth had to reveal its might

Verse 2:
She's standin' over me, I said I gotta go
Turned around quick, but I hung it up slow
What's the deal, love, what's goin' on, I see it in your face, just tell me what's wrong
Nothin', I think we need to speak, okay, well let's just have a seat
She wears a frown, she's lookin' round, sweat comin' down, and she doesn't make a sound
Tappin' on the table, gettin' impatient, I'm gettin' up, and now I start pacing

Chorus:
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin' in late?
We was still dreamin' and I had a little fight
But I guess the truth had to reveal its might

Verse 3:
She says alright, as she starts to conversate
She says It's do what you do and I say elaborate
You got that girl on the side, what if I had a guy then too?
Would your heart be broken? Boy, I'd wonder what you do
Are you tellin' me you got a dude who's lovin' you better than me?
No, but I caught ya ass, so I guess I'm settin' you free
Yeah, whatever, as a standin' pride, me and her is only friends though we never end

We got somethin' for all of y'all, we like to play, we like to ball
This is a song for all of you, when we do our thing, we got to do it true",rap

I'm a convict, these walls are my prison, they'll keep me in tonight
They see me as a menace, a threat to their perfect lives
My rage is a rebellion, my protest coming to life
They want to lock me away, my freedom is sacrificed

Verse 1
Get yourself together now, it’s time to hit the ground
Known as the hit makers, record breakers, party makers
That make your back crack, your liver quiver
To all y’all cats who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
Let me tell you this, you’ve got a hole in your soul
If you don’t dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
We’re gonna sing mighty loud and clear
Ayo, the music made ‘em jump back
Y’all ain’t got nothin’ whack, Ali’s on the attack
We got few equals, no superiors
A seasoned veteran of ego reck’nin
Turn up the notch to keep folks guessin’

Chorus
So watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y’all, it’s still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah

Verse 2
Lookin’ at me like they know me
Only as far as their drunk ass can throw me
Wanna double team for the evening, heed the lessons
You ain’t fuckin’ with the ‘Ack, better quit your feeble session
I hold the game like Notre Dame, you punk bastards in the crosshairs
Applying our thug tactics till y’all scared
Don’t stop till your drunk ass finds the back stairs
What’s that drippin’ off her nuts, why she’s got a nut sac?
You rappin’ fools, shemales from retail to the e mail
Your defeat’s felt, need some help
Y’all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y’all, it’s still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah

Verse 3
They get their shit spun, I throw a roll of quarters in cyphers
Bet I hit one, take her out for breakfast
If you want to let your lips run
I know your mission, some type of magician
That likes to go fishin’ on the mic with air tight precision
Elitism keeps tradition, when y’all ain’t even keeping the rhythm
DJ is spinnin’, calm down little camper
I got the answers, you should fuck exotic dancers
Grow a pair of tits and some antlers, it don’t matter
Turn it up, what the fuck you think that amp’s for?
Right wrongs, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And use it all to bend the frame of the ho
But I’ll just pay the waiter and go

Chorus
So watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y’all, it’s still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah
Y’all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y’all, it’s still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah",rap

One more time for the finale and now the party's past.

My success has been earned, and my name is being heard
I'm blazing a way for others, for them to learn
So many had to witness, the growth of this man
Never giving up, even when it's hard to stand

My progress is unstoppable, never pausing for a break
My will is unbreakable, and there's no mistakes
The sky's the limit, and I'm ready to take flight
Never letting them control me, I'm determined to be bright

So I'm prepped for this as a perfectionist
This is a journey that I'm ready to exist
I craft each line with precision, never letting life define me
The future's limitless, if I can stay focused and see

My mom proud of me, my dad proud of me
My grandma proud of me, grandpa you'd be too
My team is getting smaller, but I'm never surprised
Distinguished from the rest, I'm an individual my size",rap

Verse 1
I see you dancin', all over the floor
The way you move, it's just like an art
Your body's rocks, I just need to know
Can I be your man, just for tonight, I'ma show

Chorus
No girl got yours for the weekend though
Your girl taken call Liam Neeson, bro
Spring season mini skirt, sequins flow
I got her leakin' and I ain't even beatin' though
Easy ho balcony views, some Pinot Grigio

Now we havin' a good time, so you can be my girl
But only for the night, now listen

Verse 2
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl let me talk to you
I can't be your boyfriend, I thought I'd let you know
That we can have some fun tonight, but then I got to go
So you can find a better man out there on your own
Cause if I was your boyfriend, I know I'd do you wrong

Good head girl, I call it intellect
Best you ever had, and I ain't even finished yet
Do you so good, even the neighbors need a cigarette

Chorus 2
Call me Deion, the way I put the D on
Take you to the bed, the bath and beyond
Then I need to be gone, I got a flight to be on
But I never told you different, girl, listen

Outro
You got a prince, not a king
I'ma duvet, bout to move in on the queen
Like I'm playin' chess, yes
Tell me what you want to do to me
Come in the room with me, cuttin' like a movie scene
Yeah you got a man, I'm chillin', my heart's got ED
It's no hard feelings, and let me take you where you want to go
And this is something that you got to know",rap

Lemme show her something special, even the piccolo
We can have a good time, just me and you
Be a pleasure to have you, but only for the night, that's true

Verse 1:
Peep me talking on the mic
Came up from the ground I'll never let it die
Copycats tryna make the same sound
But they just aint feeling it so I'll put them on the backseat

Instead of riding wheels I'll use the beat
Livin' fast no time to sleep
Cause every night I'm blazing through the city streets

And if you keep looking, you gonna find something real
The hustle and grind, something you can't steal
Don't be fooled by the lies, keep looking to the sky
For something that won't die, keep looking!

Verse 2:
Lately we've been living on a dream
For the dough, we'll do anything
Try to balance success and learn the right lessons 
How to keep our heads up when we're feeling like nothing

Nobody said it would be easy but we'll never give up
To keep pushing is like a broken record
No matter how much it hurts we'll keep pushing on for sure

Chorus: 
And if you keep looking you gonna find something real
The hustle and grind something you can't steal
Don't be fooled by the lies, keep looking to the sky
For something that won't die, keep looking!

Verse 3:
Been searching for something, can't find no peace
Seems like everybody is trying to take my piece
I was taught to never give up so I act accordingly
And keep looking for the truth living in harmony

Cause when the night falls, I'm still on the move
Gotta stay hungry, gotta stay in the groove
If I can't find no peace then it's time to go higher
And keep looking for a place to call home, much higher!

The hustle and grind something you can't steal
Don't be fooled by the lies, keep looking to the sky

Don't care about what nobody got to say
Gone do my own thing, no matter what the price
Straight up, it's the truth that I'm living life

Brandishing words and stories untold, time's not on my side anymore,

Show the world I'm tougher than steel, step outta line and you'll feel the wrath of God.
Run your mouth, talk all you want, still you can't brave the tide,
A second chance I want to prove, that my spirit is stronger than I ever knew.
It's stronger than I can be, much stronger than I could ever see,
Ain't no use in tryin' to stop me, too late 'cause I'm already unstoppable.

And you were crying like a bitch, tougher than nails I can guarantee that

Forever we can be together, no matter bad or better

I’ll show you that love is always there
Let me love you baby, let me love you baby
Love you all the way, love you all the way

Verse 3
Looking in the eyes I can see, your heart is crying out to me
You don’t have to be scared, I’m here, when you feel lost, I’ll be your shield
We’re going on this journey together, don’t you worry bout the weather
Cause I know, no matter what, love is always there for us

Chorus 
Give me your heart, give me your hand 
I’ll show you that love is always there
Let me love you baby, let me love you baby
Love you all the way, love you all the way",rap

Gotta make it fast, gotta get it out quick and funny,
Thinkin' it'll be all good if he's stackin' the dough,
But somehow it feels like it's still further down below.

The young ones out there, they just want to get high,
Hear the sounds and cruise around with the cars in the sky,
Been lookin' for that money, just want to feel alive,
Now they sellin' their souls and they livin' in lies.

So listen and learn, my fam, cause life ain't no game,
Don't matter if you rich or you poor, nothin' will remain,

Hear me now, spokeman of many tales
Situational evidence is what I bring so listen up quick
These are my contributions to life
I'm gonna tell you what I show and what I got
I was born poor and that's what I still know
A crime-ridden street with no where to go
But despite it I kept a focus, kept a flow
I just worked hard and made sure to keep my head low
Staying up all night, no sleep to be found
I pushed myself further and further around
Had to make it to the top without a sound
But I never gave up, no backing down
And that's my contribution to life
Never quitting, never caving in
It's not about the wealth, but about the vigor within
If you wanna make it, don't let the odds wear you thin
It's all about dedication and how you stay consistent
You can make a change, no need to worry
Sometimes the steps might seem blurry
But if you take a chance you'll see the glory
And when you take a breath, you'll feel the story
So rise up, start to hustle
Don't get comfortable or get too bloated

Work through the pain and don't let it get you
Stop complaining, start gaining, make sure you're attaining
Work hard and don't get complacent

Don't just talk about change, take a step and make a stand
Put your money where your mouth is and make a difference

It's gotta come from the inside, no getting confused

I think of when we laughed and our hands touched 
Our hearts beating in time, and I wonder what went wrong with us

A thousand miles apart and still I feel you near 
The memories of us come flooding back to me when I close my eyes and shed a tear

Gonna make a mark, I'ma prove that I'm the best
Move through the night and get the ends to the rest",rap

I'm flipping rap game, be careful not to trip out
My wordplay got your head spinning like a cyclone
I work hard, I don't need to flex
Cause in the rap game, I'm the next vet

My flow's sick, like a cold that won't quit
Rock the party, with a hook that'll hit
I stay sharp, like a scissors cut
You hear it clear, like I'm talking through a megaphone

Make moves with my team, trying to stack cheese
On the mic, I'm like a wild beast
As I go in, everybody's like, ""Wow!""
They see me waving my flag, like I'm ready for a pow-wow

We bring the heat to the stage, gotta keep them feeling high
Never slip, we never die, riding until the day we die
I mess with the rhymes like magma, no drama
Like I'm writing the book of rap, my name is Obama

My rhymes is heavy, like a ton of steel
I kill it on the mic like I'm a serial thrill
My lyrics are fresh, like a head of lettuce
I got the fans singing the chorus, like a gospel choir seeking blessing

My rap is the truth, like a judge in a trial
I got my crowd hyped, living life without denial
I'm dropping fire like a blazing volcano
Been rocking shows since the day I stepped in the game, yo",rap

And I ain't afraid to start a fight.
I tell ya don't, but you still test me,
That's when the gun gets drawn and ready.
I don't get mad, no, I get even,
I take it personal when things get heated.

Chorus
What go around come around, what go around come around,
What go around come around, what go around come around.

Get buck wild, out of control,
I gotta stay low and remain low key.
No one can come for me,
I won't let it be, the streets are dangerous, you gotta be free.
Take out my enemies, don't let 'em breathe,
Just hold it down and still keep the peace.
Don't take it to violence that's what I preach,
Mess it up and it'll be your head on the beach.

What go around come around, what go around come around,
What go around come around, what go around come around.",rap

""Money and Fame""

Verse 1:
High on cocaine, you know who I am
Grabbed my gold chains and now I'm fly as a lamb
Hollywood's calling, the girls all running
Your momma wants me, yeah, you better recognize me
That skinny white boy from MTV and Scary Movie 3
I'm rappin' now they call me Dirt Nasty and I'm almost famous
Signin' autographs with all my girls takin' pics
(Chorus)
Money and fame, getting pussy for free
Hollywood City of Dreams, gold chains on the silver screen
In bed with the illest freaks, I kill the pussy just like I killed this beat
I'm in US Weekly again, fuckin Martha Stewart
Fresh outta pen, at the Ivy eatin' BLTs
Buttlicking time on TMZ, used to be D-list before I made it
Fuck the fat chicks just to pay rent, now that I'm on top of the A-list
You wanna fuck me you gotta go through my agent

Verse 2:
Getting pussy was always easy for me
Maybe 'cause I was on TV, your mom and your aunt both want my meat
That's cool, we can keep it in the family
Your girlfriend wanna eat my meat, what's my name, Bitch? Dirt Nasty
Fame is a funny thing, I almost got it and when I do
I'm gonna go crazy, get my dick sucked in Cabo San Lucas
On my private yacht, airplane combination Ferrari
Dirt Nasty baby, I love you.",rap
"

Verse 1
Stunting round town, shining like a diamond
Dress designer brands and my gold chains glowin
Headlines on the news rap game worldwide known
Hollywood wants me, girls wanna be my own
Name on the tip of every rappers tongue
Dirt Nasty the one that never gets no love
But now I’m in the limelight, takin off like a rocket
Everybody stan, they know they can’t stop it

Chorus
Getting pussy was always easy to me
Maybe because I was on TV
Your mom and your aunt both wanna treat me
That’s cool your girl can keep me in the family
Getting pussy was always easy to me
Maybe because I was on TV
Your girlfriend wanna eat my meat
What’s my name bitch, Dirt Nasty

Verse 2
Fame is a funny thing, almost got it and then
I’m in Cabo San Lucas, livin’ on a yacht
Five star chef servin’ me the best of the best
Ain’t no better feelin’ than livin’ life with no stress
Take ‘em shopping, leave ‘em with the bags full
Fly ‘em out to Rome, living life swole
Money and fame, gettin’ pussy for free
Put my name on your girl titties, it ain’t hard to see

Chorus
Getting pussy was always easy to me
Maybe because I was on TV
Your mom and your aunt both wanna treat me
That’s cool your girl can keep me in the family

I'm tryin' to break away, livin' life in a cage
Gotta make it to the top without gettin' too strange
When the world is movin' fast, no time to slow down
Try to stay one step ahead and make sure I don't drown

Gotta keep my composure and stay focused on the plan
No matter what life throws at me I'm doin' all I can
Hustlin' hard, keepin' grinding 'til the mission is complete
My faith is unbreakable and I'm ready for the streets

I lost my emotions they say that I'm potent
Drinkin' all them potions, need a little more drugs with it
Back on the papers, inhaling the vapors
I'm feeling amazing, my body blazing

Fuck what they say, I'ma keep my head in the game
I'm gon' reach my dreams and chase the money and fame
Time is precious, can't afford to lose any
Don't forget who I am and why I'm alive today

Gotta trust the process and know that it won't be easy
Heard about these haters tryna bring me down to my knees
No time to chicken out, better stand firm in the fight
Don't get caught up in the moment 'cause a nigga might push up on it

No time to wait 'til the morning, know right where I'm zoning
By the time I'm off the bridge, don't forget I don't forgive
Don't let 'em put me down, livin' life with no regrets
Puttin' on for my city, this rap music is my debt",rap
"

My life's like a verse in a rap song, my path is so long
I'm living life with only one chance, I must stay strong
I've faced my fair share of pain and strife, but I don't belong
The way I'm feeling is too hard to contain, this world's so wrong

The days are draggin' and the nights are strong, Pressure and doubt they won't leave me alone
But I'm not breakin', I'm here carryin' on, No use dwelling on what shouldn't be drawn
Life's too short to be stuck and stayin' strong, I'm gonna move up and keepPushin' on

I'm done with my father's lies, that's not my thing
I gotta spread my wings and realize what freedom brings
Take control of my life, put trust in my dreams, Take a chance and focus on what success means
Adversity's still around, but I'm still tryin' my best
To take the pain and make it so it can't mess with my zest

I hit the street and find what I'm searching for
I'm only living once, and I don't take it for granted of course
I'm telling the world I'm doing just fine, don't care what they think, cuz all I know is my mind
Fighting for the future, and this time I'm sure to succeed
My spirit's lit, I'm off the ground and gonna fly with my dreams",rap
"

I'm the lyrical prodigy, blessed with the gift of poetry,
My soul just bleeds, my words they come with no apology,
From the south side of VA, support me or let me be,
Inside my head the lyrics fly, it's plain for all to see,

Gospel of the streets, what I speak is the truth,
Had to pay my dues, the struggle was never smooth,
From the dirtiest of alleys, I rose from poverty,
The beats I write and the flows I bring, that's just how it be,

My rhymes like bullets shoot, all these haters leave me be,
No nonsense talk, all these niggas swear they know me,
I hustle, I grind, I take pride in what I do,
Rapping, I'm just trying to get by, get a couple bands too,

My crew, they the realest, we ride or die together,
No squares telling us what to do, we make the rules,
We keep it real, we don't care what ya'll think,
The industry bullshit, we just smoke it out the window while we driff,

Came from nothin but I'm somethin, what I do is rare,
Head to toe in designer boots, Gucci, Louis and Prada,
Better to be somebody for one day, than a nobody for your whole life,
Puttin on for the hood, that's what I do, that's my pride,

These rhyme so tight, cause in the hood, that's how we survive,
From East 34th to JFK, I've been around,
My true money comin from the music, so this why I'm in the sound,
Jet piff and the fire red 5s, lyrically I'm fly,
Take a trip around the world and I know it'd still be mine",rap
"

My talk to ya' coming from the hoods,
The projects and the blocks where life ain't good,
Where dreams ain't realized and there's no food,
In the same city where dreams ain't good,
Two hustles to survive and no one's doin' it right,
Forget the gun and the knife the pen and the mic,
The only way to make it out and be somebody bright,
From the bottom of the hood to the top of the lights,

And now I'm on the come up and they know I'm a star,
My flow is so icy and my rhymes go so far,
My grind is off the chain and my swag is for sure,
They know I'm gonna take it higher and rise to the top,
I'm never settling for less and I'm gonna get mine,
What I put in the game yo I'm gonna take it out,
I'm the king of this game and I'm gonna take what's mine,
Cause I put too much work in for me to stop now,

My swag is out of this world and my style's unique,
My flow is like water, it's smooth and it's sweet,
So when I'm in the booth it's like I'm on a mission,
Delivering these rhymes with no hesitation,
My hunger is insatiable and my hustle is loud,
I'm never settling for less and I'm climbing higher,
From the city that care forgot to all of the planets,
My style, my life, my flow is all the same,

From east 34th to JFK
By helicopter I'm in the magazines,
You're in barbershops bumping the mix,
My bitches rock it and my niggas hit it,
For days I'm on the grind, never missing a beat,
My mission is to keep it real, to never flaunt the fame,
Living life to the fullest, against all odds,
I'm never settling for less, I'm climbing higher and higher,

My cheddar's always getting bigger and my money's always tight,
My swag is off the roof and my truck is for life,
Always going against the grain, never letting the hate take over,
Where the weak always fall and the strong don't just survive,
My mind is focused and there's no way I'll ever fail,
I'm never settling for less and I'm gonna take what's mine,
From east 34th to JFK by helicopter,
I'm in the magazines and I'm always bumpin' the mix,
Giving it my all and never quitting, 
It's my life and it was never gonna be easy,
But if I fall I'll rise again, taking it higher and higher.",rap

Ain't no guest list for the show, for my Raf I don't pay,

Stripe print, floral and all kind of others.

My Raf look fierce, so don't even try and anderson.

Droppin' lines with a rare Raf, know it sound so clean,
I'm always rockin' Raf, and I got all the style and the jeani.

My Rafs on my frame, my Rafs on my face,
Keepin' it real when it come down to style and grace.

I'm stuntin on the dudes when I step in the set
Ya can't hate on me when I'm Rafin the steps
I'm lookin at the clock and its time to flip some checks
Yeah I'm geekin on Raf yeah my closet is so fresh
I'm tryin to make sure that I keep it all blessed
I'm stackin my money in Raf up on the shelf
I know they so hard to come by so I got it by myself
The rafs so hard to get and I been gettin lucky
Got a long list of Raf and I'm ready to show
Got the bleepin, Raf jeans, Raf suits, and all the Raf shoes
Got too many hats it looks like a museum
I'm on a whole new level when I'm Rafin up the skylines
I'm rocking Raf for all the different seasons
I'm dressed head to toe all Raf from the party to the meeting
Nobody can touch me when I'm lookin head to toe in Raf
Don't even try to come up and touch my bag
I got a gang of Raf from all over the map
My wardrobe is lookin like artwork ima rep it so hard
Apostrophe S, Raf Simons, and Celine keep me on the radar
Yeah I'm fly as hell don't forget I'm Rafing

Verse 1
It's been such a long time since I seen your face
Been wondering lately if I can find you in this place
I can't move on from the memory of you and me
The moments that fill my soul just feel so empty

Chorus
Was it even real to you baby cause it was real to me
Was it even real cause if it was real where are you going
Is it still the same way that you wanted it the same way that you needed it
So tell me if it's real baby tell me if it's real, tell me how you feel

Verse 2
It's the same questions I keep asking myself
If we had one more chance could I embrace the help
It's a hard pill to swallow when it wasn't meant to be
It's like trying to catch a star and never getting it in your reach

Chorus
Was it even real to you baby cause it was real to me
Was it even real cause if it was real where the fuck are you going
Is it still the same way that you wanted it the same way that you needed it
So tell me if it's real, so tell me if it's real, fuckin' tell me how you feel

Bridge
Lesson learned, where are you now, where are you going
Where are you now, where are we going
Cause I just wanna feel you now, just wanna feel you now
Yeah, so tell me if it's real, tell me how you feel
Cause I just wanna lay you down, just wanna feel you now.",rap
"

Verse 1:
Laying in my bed with questions in my head
Look around and memories fill my head
Was it even real for you baby, cause it was real for me
But if it was real, then why you leavin' me?

Chorus: 
So tell me if it's real, baby, tell me if it's real
Tell me how you feel, ooohhohoohh
I wear no colors today, window sounds of rain
Nobody at the bar, L.A. is grey today

Verse 2:
Where are you now, where are you going?
Is it still the same way that you remember it?
Or were there times when it was over with?
Where are you now, where are we going?

Chorus: 
Do you wanna change the way you remember it?
Do you wanna change, was it even real to you baby?
Cause it was real to me, was it even real?
If it was real where the fuck are you going?

Bridge:
Lesson learned, where are you now, where are you going?
Where are you now, where are we going?
Cause I just wanna feel you now, just wanna feel you now
Yeah so tell me if it's real, tell me how you feel

Cause I just wanna lay you down, just wanna feel you now
So tell me if it's real, baby, tell me if it's real
Tell me how you feel, ooohhohoohh",rap

Look at me, i'm shining bright
My flow is on point, it's got some bite
I'm here to take the crowd by surprise
My rhymes are pure, they mesmerize

My lyrics are mystical, magical
They have a power, they are radical
Can't keep up, don't even try
My flow is super, it makes you fly

Rap is a game, no one can deny
Skill on the mic, gonna make em cry
I let the bars flow, they come alive
Can't even touch me, I'm too alive

My flow is high, I'm never low
Bring it back to the way it used to go
This rap game, I'm controlling it
My verses flowing, I'm never letting it quit

Everything I touch, I'm taking it higher
No need to worry, I'm always a fire
This is what I do and what I love
Bring it back to the way it's supposed to be, I'm above

Verse so deep, no one can mine
My movements smooth, I'm never behind
I'm dropping bars, right to the floor
My rap game, it's setting the score",rap

[Verse 1]
One hand on the mic, one hand on the rock
Ain't no time for slackin', this is one time shock
The crowd's a riled up, when I step on the scene
Ya'll better salute me, I'm the king of this dream
It's been a long time comin', so many trials and tribulations
But I'm here now and I'm gonna keep rappin'
No one can touch me, my flow's too legit
See, I'm the original and they're just a copy of it

[Verse 2]
I'm just climbin' to the top, lookin' to take that throne
My rhymes are so hard, I could break the vocal tone
Look at all the rookies, tryin' to match my rhyme
But they just can't keep up, won't ever pass my line
It's no wonder why, they don't have the skill
To keep up with the best, even with the pills
It's all about the flow, and I'm a master
My rap is so raw, it could burn your plaster

[Verse 3]
I'm likin' the time I'm livin' in, for rap
It's a new era, this is a classic rap
It's all about the knowledge, it's not just about the money
We got people tryin' to ruin, with their fake and fake honey
But I'm here, to show 'em all the way
Gonna bring hip-hop back, back to the golden age
Back to the days, when we were just kids
And we were out there, just livin' it

[Chorus]
Rap's underground railroad, but nothing's above me
I stay blooming like a spring break flower child
I get classy like you just got a scholarship
I'm here to bring hip-hop back, back to the Golden Age",rap
" 2 3 4

Hold up peace to the gang, we on that raw street grind 
Forever need a hook up for them thangs on my side 
Respect that's due, all the homies gotta show it 
Cause without em it's a no-go, no need to let em know it 

Gotta keep the money comin', livin' like the rich and famous 
Me & my team somethin' like a pack of hyenas 
I shine in the evening, got it from the start 
Keep it real no lyin', no, no lyin' in my heart 

My lyrics are vibes, I drop bars for a reason 
The beat is everything, you hear it goin' off in the season 
We got the moves and the muscles, you know we comin' for it 
I want the cash, stacks on stacks, diamonds and solid gold 

I'm bringing that heat, got that fire in my soul 
Got the keys to the city, ride the metro when I go 
I'm thinking a major money plan, got the dollars in abundance 
Rollin' in foreign cars, I'm really just chillin' in the trenches 

Gonna keep it real like a game of chess 
The haters are tryna come and test, call it stress 
But I'ma stay focused, I'm still in this 
My eyes on the prize, no more livin' in the abyss 

Top of the game, the morning breaks 
I won't ever change, the raps will remain

Jump out of my car, the haters scared, gettin' money in the night

Yeah my flow's so smooth I got it on lock
Speakin in tongues, I'm tryin to drop a beat like a shock

Verse 1
Time is ticking and the light is leaving, 
The shadows take their place, trynna keep me believing 
That I can still come out on top and turn this around 
But I'm drowning in the depths and there's no way out of this ground 
I throw my fists up at the sky, I wanna take it back 
But I know that I can't turn the time and now it's all gone past
The bitterness is seeping in, my frozen heart can't break out 
And I can't seem to cope with all this pain, without a doubt

Chorus
Stay in the shadows, running out of time
Gotta keep on moving and use the darkness as a sign 
I want to watch it drown, I can't say what we should have been 
Light is leaving inside of me and I don't know what it means
Stay in the shadows, running out of time 
I want to watch it drown, never giving in

Verse 2
This pain is weighing on me and I'm trying to be strong 
But it's so hard to keep on running, when I don't know where I belong 
So I just keep on pushing through and try to stay on the path 
But the darkness surrounds me and I just can't seem to react 
I'm struggling to breathe, but I still try to take control 
And I must keep on going 'til I finally find a role
The time is running out, all I can do is pray 
That I can make it out of here before the light fades away 

Chorus
Stay in the shadows, running out of time
Gotta keep on moving and use the darkness as a sign 
I want to watch it drown, I can't say what we should have been 
Light is leaving inside of me and I don't know what it means
Stay in the shadows, running out of time 
I want to watch it drown, never giving in",rap

Verse 1
I'm in a dark night, feelin' so alone
Living in a cold world, I've run out of hope
Gloomy shadows follow me everywhere I go
Tryin' to cope, but the weight's too heavy to bear

Chorus 1
Stay in shadow, I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow, it's running out of time
Stay in shadow, I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now, I want to watch it drown

Verse 2
My heart is aching as I watch you go
Shattered pieces laying on the ground below
Can't bear the thought of a life without you
But I still have to face what I'm going through

Chorus 2
Stay in shadow, I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow, it's running out of time
Stay in shadow, I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now, I want to watch it drown

Bridge
Everything's become so cold and grey
There's not a single ray of light for me to find my way
I'm searching in vain for something more
But I'm being consumed by what I'm sure

Chorus 3
Stay in shadow, I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow, it's running out of time
Stay in shadow, I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now, I want to watch it drown",rap

davy davy crockett king of the wild frontier
Yeah davy davy crockett king of the wild frontier
From the city streets he heard a wild sound
He moved his feet and found an Indian town
He strolled around on a mission for a date
But he knew it'd be hard to find his soul mate
He saw her from far with her head held up high
Her beauty and strength could fill the sky
Her body moved like the wind of the night
He wanted to talk and see what was in sight

She had swag, she had confidence to show
He knew he'd have to step his game up, so
He asked her if she had the time to talk
She said of course, but she don't like to walk
She had no regard for his mind or his heart
Though he thought he had taken the right start
He told her his name, but she didn't care
She said, ""My name's Running Rabbit, let our story share.""

He said, ""Yeah, I'm Dave, the one girls adore
They say I'm sweet and I've got a good flow
So what do you say, won't you go with me
We'll go to my place and we'll make history.""

She said, ""Let's go to my house, my father's the chief
Let's go have dinner, I guarantee relief
He's made the worst spaghetti, so bad it's a sin
It's too late to take it back, so let's just dig in.""

After dinner, naps, and conversation,
They felt like the tension needed a breakthrough
To the bedroom they finally made it through
Sitting by the window, looking on the moon
He asked her if she was in the mood
She said no, but he thought she meant yes
So he started touching her and coming out of his chest

He whispered sweet nothings and sang a song
His head was in between her titties, they were soft and long
He said he was in the mood for love
She said, ""Please take it easy, Dave, you're hurting me, stop!""

But he kept going and she kept groaning
He said he was in the mood for more
He was riding her with crazy force
But then she said, ""Wait, stop, I can't take this anymore!""

He heard a strange sound and he was both scared and excited
He opened the intimate area and saw crabs with spears and indian drums
He said, ""What the..? You can talk?!""
She said, ""Yes, no need to gawk, now it's time to walk.""

Yeah davy davy crockett king of the wild frontier
A wild adventure, a tale of a lifetime
He left with lessons and a story entwined.",rap

He started to run feeling crazy and free
As he made his way back out to the wild frontier
Ain't no telling what could have happened that night
Woulda gotten a wife or just ended up in a fight

He made it back to the West and ended up a King
From what people said it's like he had wings
He was never scared when it came time to fight
He had courage and strength to face the night

Davy Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier
He earned a reputation from far and near
He took on any challenge that tried to stand in his way
And with guns blazing, he'd never turn away

He could be found with a rifle and a bow
Shooting targets and wildlife like he just don't know
Of course Davy was a hunter, but that wasn't all
He made sure he never took the animals' fall

Davy Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier
He wore a hat of raccoon, with plenty of fur
He took on the odds and won, many times in his life
He was always faced with danger, without fear or strife

He was a hero and a legend, ready to go
Full of wisdom and knowledge that he shared with the world
So don't think he was a failure, because he was not
For Davy Davy Crockett's the King of the Wild Frontier.",rap

Verse 1
Take me out to Neverland, where a reality I can expand 
Envisioning my hopes and dreams, in no time I'll have them in hand 
My mind is free to explore, to find the things I'm looking for 
A world of joy and pure emotion, no reason to be anymore forlorn 

Chorus
Take me out to Neverland, show me what's behind these closed doors 
To me, what's real's what I can see, so take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, so take me out to Neverland again

Verse 2
I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, contemplating what I truly wish
To fulfill these ambitions, all I need is a single wish
The stars are bright, shining in the night, and I take flight 
To a place of pure satisfaction, nothing but joy in my sight 

Chorus
Take me out to Neverland, show me what's behind these closed doors 
To me, what's real's what I can see, so take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, so take me out to Neverland again

Verse 3
Exploring what I know to be real, but it still seems so surreal 
Never knowing what I will find, but I'll take it in stride 
My heart is filled with eagerness, testing my limits while I'm fearless 
Seeking to discover the wonders of this world and so much more, yeah

Chorus
Take me out to Neverland, show me what's behind these closed doors 
To me, what's real's what I can see, so take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, so take me out to Neverland again",rap

Verse 1 
Take me out to Neverland, I'm looking for a new view 
A paradise far away, to fill me with bliss, it's true 
The world around me is cold, no comfort in these bars 
My tired soul needs a break, take me to those stars

Chorus
Take me out to Neverland, show me what's behind these closed doors 
To me what's real is what I can see, so take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, so take me out to Neverland again

Verse 2 
My heart is longing for joy, to lighten up my gloom 
My spirit needs a revive, can Neverland make room? 
I'm yearning for a surprise, for something I can hold 
C'mon and take me away, the urge is getting old

Chorus
Take me out to Neverland, show me what's behind these closed doors 
To me what's real is what I can see, so take me out to Neverland 
Take me out to Neverland, take me out to Neverland

Outro
Take me out to Neverland, I'm ready to explore this dream 
It's been too long just sitting here, my wings are ready to take flight, it seems 
Let's leave this world behind, turn this page and come alive 
Give me one night of a thousand stars, and we'll soar to Neverland tonight!",rap

At the strip club they come to see me, I got the cash and they seein it
And I'm countin all these benjis, makin sure that I'm on the rise
Money talk an I'm listenin, now I'm livin like the good life

Takin it back to the basics, with my hood tucked tight
The streets of my hood made me, now I'm layin down the soundtrack tonight
Got my hoodies, got my jeans, and I'm ready to go
Got my hood on my back, that's my hood and I'm lettin it show

Your bitch she wet she leakin, don't fuck with these niggas, you sneakin
Cant turn my back on my hood, need me when you gettin money stack it up for a reason
Take a look at my life, my squad let me lead'em, make it to the top so they can never defeat'em
Bared Vette on the highway, I'm just tryin to get to the million
I got hoes on my line, but none of that means a thing
Everywhere I go I'm gettin money, naw forreal, I got a grip
Stackin up the Benjis, in the trap livin life on the flip

They call me the CEO, naw forreal I'm a millionaire
Don't be hatin on my riches, I'm a young king live in the air
Surrounded by my team, with nothing but good vibes
Gonna get this money any way I can, I'm tryin to stay alive

Your bitch she wet she leakin, don't fuck with these niggas, you sneakin
Cant turn my back on my hood, need me when you gettin money stack it up for a reason
Take a look at my life, my squad let me lead'em, make it to the top so they can never defeat'em
My fam they need me, I'm gonna show em what they been missin
I'm gonna keep it real with them, no lyin, no sinnin
Gotta keep it movin, can't let nobody stop me
I'm only hopin for the best, my future's brighter than the sunlight",rap

Verse 1
My life's been a rush, try to get the money and hush
I been going hard since I was tryna get a buzz
I sold my beats for a couple bread, now every night I'm off to bed
Came a long way from seeing the gangs at the edge

Chorus
Your bitch she wet she leakin, don't fuck with you niggas you sneakin
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me when you gettin' money stack it up for a reason
Take a look at my life back then, trap season when you make it
Everybody think that it's easy, my family need me, my squad let me lead 'em

Verse 2
See me in the trap before selling a pack, got me chillin with felons with all the back attacks
Sippin vodka, rollin up blunts and smokin' out the blunt wrappers
I'm trynna get the money and skrt out of here like a wraith
Knew it wasn't gonna be easy, but I kept my faith
Mama said keep your head high, none of them can take you away

Chorus
Your bitch she wet she leakin, don't fuck with you niggas you sneakin
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me when you gettin' money stack it up for a reason

Verse 3
They want me to take a fall, but I'm standing tall
Gotta keep grindin' everyday and night just to get that cash
I came a long way and worked hard, no time to relax
Feelin' like a boss, makin' moves and stayin active
Offered by a label but I opted to go independent
Nigga livin' life, just keep goin' and don't pretend it
See me on the road with the top down, can't no one stop me

Chorus 
Your bitch she wet she leakin, don't fuck with you niggas you sneakin
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me when you gettin' money stack it up for a reason

Verse1
My day started off a little weak, 
Headin' to school with my breakfast to eat 
I thought about the girl who stole my heart 
One look was all it took to start 

Verse2
The teacher said it was time for class 
My attention turned to the girl with the sass 
A tap on the door brought me joy 
My heart raced and my eyes lit with the boy 

Chorus
Man, it's just one of those days 
Where nothing goes right no matter how hard I try 
No matter what I do I just can't get away 
It's just one of those days 

Verse3
So now I'm in the hall with a lecture to hear 
Still thinking of the girl and the thrill of her near 
The teacher's jaw dropped and then shouted ""what"" 
She put it in my face, I had been caught

Verse4
My luck was running low, I had to take the fall 
Thrown out of school, couldn't take it at all 
The failed attempt to see the girl was done 
My day had taken a turn for the worse, it was just one of those days 

Chorus
Man, it's just one of those days 
Where nothing goes right no matter how hard I try 
No matter what I do I just can't get away 
It's just one of those days 

Bridge
I hopped on my bike and started to ride 
Cops were in pursuit and my heart was in flight 
The girl was so close I just had to look 
But that cost me sweet freedom, I was in the cook 

Verse5
So here I sit in a cell, without much to do 
Thinking of the girl, my one and only clue 
Maybe one day I'll wise up, make wiser decisions 
But for now it's just one of those days with no luck in my vision 

Chorus
Man, it's just one of those days 
Where nothing goes right no matter how hard I try 
No matter what I do I just can't get away 
It's just one of those days",rap

Verse 1

Woke up in the morning with a plan in my head
But Murphy's Law was alive, seemed like I was already dead
Things went from bad to worse, hard to catch my breath
My day started off cool but it went down 'fore I left

Chorus

No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't break the string of bad luck
My day was filled with heartache and a whole lotta bad luck
Can't believe the stuff that happened, it made me wanna cry
Just one of those days, fillin' me with all the why why why

Verse 2

I got dressed and went to school, my stomach groaning
And then I stopped by the store, to get me something I'm ownin'

Breakfast treats of sweet and tang, bubble yum pack and a tasty cake
Walked into my class and said whats up to the girls I'm tryna take

Chorus

No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't break the string of bad luck
My day was filled with heartache and a whole lotta bad luck
Can't believe the stuff that happened, it made me wanna cry
Just one of those days, fillin' me with all the why why why

Verse 3

My day was taking a turn, I was thrown for a loop
When a pretty girl walked in, my heart skipped a few beats
Couldn't help but notice, my arm outstretched
The teacher saw me and she almost lost her breath

I tried to explain myself, but the teacher had seen
My day was taking a dive, can't believe what I had done
She wrote the pink slip and she sent me to the guidance
I was so mad, I think I was losing my patience

Chorus

No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't break the string of bad luck
My day was filled with heartache and a whole lotta bad luck
Can't believe the stuff that happened, it made me wanna cry
Just one of those days, fillin' me with all the why why why

Bridge

I went running to the head of discipline, I tried to play it off, I started to laugh
But he just told me, lucky child, don’t come back here, and you better go wild
And as I walked out I just said “Man, it’s just one of those days”

Outro

One of those days, just one of those days
Where everything bad happens and nothing good comes my way
No matter what I do, I can’t get this bad luck to change
It’s just one of those days, and it’s not turnin’ out the same 
No matter how hard I try, I just can’t break the string of bad luck
It’s just one of those days, fillin’ me with all the why why why",rap

I'ma roll with my homies don't need no enemies
Hold a four five in the hood that's how it's supposed to be
Ain't no church in the wild but I'm still believing
Living life as a hustler hit the streets to make a killin'

I rep the broken wings and try to beat the odds
But they been out to get me since the day I was born
These same people living it up in a mansion high
But I'm still riding fast and looking for my own get by

I stay underground and keep it on the low key
My enemies attack me I just shoot back with the cold heat
I'm steady grinding I'ma get up out this hood fast
If I drop a verse I'ma blow up with the G-lock blast

Came from the bottom I'ma get up out of my own way
No more being a victim of the streets I'ma be my own prey
I'ma get to the money and never ever turn around
No more hating for me that's the only way I'ma be found

We all got our struggles just gotta find our own way
Call on Jesus when I'm lost I'ma ask him to show me the way
I'ma shed the hate, let it go and stay humble like a G
Try to do right by the world and be the best MC

This ain't nothing but a blessing so I'ma keep it going strong
Combining music with living, keep them beats and lyrics in a song
Real recognize real so I gotta stay in control
Z-Ro be the name and my message to the world is Roll",rap
"

I'm from the bottom living fast where the trap be,
All I ever wanted was stacks and a bad bitch with me,
My mama told me growing up life ain't no myth,
She said if you don't stay true you gon' wind up on the strip
But I ain't never had no fear I'm a renegade,
I'ma ride until the wheels fall off a never ending raid,
Eyes dead like a shark fin I'm feeling invincible
So I be on the grind I'm tryna get that cheese and I'ma win

Lord knows if I get the chance I'm gonna take it
Cause street life ain't no joke you gotta stay at it
I'm living hard so they know they can't break it
From the hood rule number one is to never fake it
But these niggas too busy flexing and they too busy judging,
When I see my niggas drop I'ma show 'em all some love
Cause without them I'ma be nothing and that's why I stay true,
I come from a place where they don't make it but we do

In the hood they don't feel me cause they think I'm too young,
But I'm a diamond in the dirt and I'ma shine like the sun,
I shine like a star unleashed when I rep HTOWN,
And I'mma show the world the truth about a couple of clowns
I know the truth about the streets, it's no sugar instead it's salt,
And I'mma keep on paying my dues until I make it to the top,
I got the heart of a lion and I'm always going to stand tall,
But I ain't here to cry I'ma never let them see me fall

You can take it how you wanna take it I don't give a damn,
I'ma ride for my niggas and never care about the clamor,
I'm a student of the game and I'm gonna speak my mind,
My head to the sky and my feet to the grind
Cause I'm a soldier in the hood, a G till I die
Standing at the crossroads of dreams and reality,
I got the power to make it out but I'm gonna stay and fight,
Cause my city Houston Texas is my bread and butter tonight",rap

More rings on my fingers than roman numerals

My flow is like I'm cryin' out of a fire hydrant

Don't get mad at me, I'm livin' life lavishly
Because I'm reppin' as far as the eye can see

I had a lot of bitches, livin' their best life
Doin' whatever I said, even the ho on the street
But I'm a real dog and I'ma dog out my broads
Guerrilla pimpin', driving four door cars
Ain't got no kids, but them bitches love daddy
They had to share me or they couldn't have me
Cause I'm a mack with a capital M
Call me Too Short, baby put the pimp in the scheme

Get out of her pocket, bitch, you gettin' beat up
You see me hangin' with them niggas like Jock
Every single five miles, bitches gettin' popped

Verse 2

Nobody can stop me, I got a bad rep
I beat my broad ass, she moved back home
Came in one night, I was buzzin' bitch
Tried to front me for fuckin' her cousin
She started yellin', man, the bitch got raw
I took one step back and went straight to her jaw
I don't give a fuck, that the bitch left
Cause all she ever got was some good dick
And it really ain't shit to find another ho
Cause I'm a cool motherfucker, and I'm hella rich

Grab the mic, nigga, fuck these hoes
Ant Banks yep I'm thinkin' back
Before a nigga just came up, playin' games with the bitches
Thought a nigga might change, but I was tight
Thinkin' everything's all right, doin' the same shit to a different ho
Every night just dickin' 'em down like a gigolo
So you gotta peep game from a nigga though
I'm too young to get sprung, so don't trip, said 'em so

And I hate I gotta be that way
Goin' vicious on these bitches just made 'em all leave today
But I know it won't last long, they sayin' fuck Ant Banks
Now all my bitches is gone, too Short, all my bitches are gone
Them bitches bounced, had a gang of 'em, now they can't be found

My life has been full of pain and sorrow, 
But I'm gonna fight and make it through tomorrow.
I'll show the world the definition of real shit,
My struggles and hustle, they'll never forget it.
I want to be an example, and a role model,
Teaching kids that dreams will never be omissible.
Never gonna stop, no matter how hard it gets,
My spirit remains strong, I know it won't forget.

My faith and my hustle, that's all I need,
Ain't no time to be fooling around, stay focused and stay on your feet.
Tell the haters to move on and find somewhere else to be,
This is for the real ones, come along and ride with me.

My pride and my drive, my passion and my sound, 
Going the extra mile, never gonna let the demons take me down.
I'm getting back on my feet, I'm getting back my crown,
Anything I put my mind to, I'm gonna make it stick around.

My story and my grind, what I'mma show the world,
I ain't afraid of nothin', I'mma give it all I got and never gonna back down.
This is a blessing, no longer a curse,
Gonna make sure my future's brighter, give the people what they deserve.

We gon show the world the definition of real shit,
My brother you gotta feel it, lil hustler,
We gon show the world the definition of real shit,
My nigga you gotta feel it, lil nigga.


Let's put the hustle on, get up and go,
Bringing the definition of real shit, wherever I go.
I'm gonna do it for my fam, for all the ones who believe,
Show the world what it means to hustle, no time to grieve.

My mission and my goal, gonna make it all come true,
When I rap these bars, I'm gonna make it loud and true.
Nothing's ever gonna be the same, this is a brand new start, 
I'm gonna be the king of the game, I got the lyrics and the heart.

We gon show the world the definition of real shit,
My brother you gotta feel it, lil hustler,

Verse 1
We’re gonna show the world the definition of realness,
My brother you gotta feel it, lil’ hustler, listen in.
Our story is one of struggle, the pain starts at the beginning,
Lost all hope with no food, no hope, no ending. 
Pressured by the radio, they tell us we can't win,
Expressing our story, so they understand what we been in.
We break the chains, paid our dues and now we’re free,
Bringing our story to the world, they need to see. 

Chorus 
We’re gonna show the world the definition of real shit,
My brother you gotta feel it, lil’ hustler, it’s our time to hit.

Verse 2
I remember when I was hustling for nothing but my life,
Just trying to make it out alive, that was the price.
My heart was heavy, but I kept pushing through the night,
Struggle was real and it didn't get easier when the light. 
It got harder but I knew I could make it if I tried,
I told myself this is the only way out of this ride.
So I battled on, just to stand on top,
Gotta make it out of the struggle and never stop.

Chorus 
We’re gonna show the world the definition of real shit,
My brother you gotta feel it, lil’ hustler, it’s our time to hit.
We’re gonna show the world the definition of realness,
My nigga you gotta feel it, lil’ nigga, come on and witness.

Verse 3
I'm gonna show the world, giving my life as a lesson,
My journey will be known, no matter where I’m stressing.
If you stare at the stars, you'll see that I've seen it all,
All I ask is you listen and learn, no matter the call.
My mission is clear, keep my head up like I'm a king,
Hip hop is my thing and I'mma keep going 'til the end.
Gonna teach the kids, they need to know the real,
They don't have to struggle, it's just how they feel.

Chorus 
We’re gonna show the world the definition of real shit,
My brother you gotta feel it, lil’ hustler, it’s our time to hit.
We’re gonna show the world the definition of realness,

Colt .45 on my hip, so I never take a trip
Ain't got time for police and their hitting the skit
Out in the hood I'm the premier, hotter than a serin
I got me a rap and I'm using it for a weapon
Cops try and chase me, but I'm running like a ninja
My jumpshot ain't half bad, seven ticks and I'm in it
My words paint a picture of a life gone astray
Struggling to make a dollar, another day and I play
Some of us come up with the luck of a lotto
Others, you can only hear when the tommy guns go
Gang bangers on the block, they be straight up shooting
My squad be all ready, but it still ain't enough troops
Lost and found in the hood all I see is darkness
Still, I'ma keep my head, no matter the cost
I don't want to die today but I've got twenty eight in my microwave
Everybody in the hood really like my yay, clear and uncut got no time to play

I got me some hustle, but these hoes ain't impressed
Tales of the struggle, I'm a teller like the rest
Only God forgive, so I'm asking Him everyday
Everybody got to roll and the dice in the game
I'm still steady hustling, tryin to make some paper
Can't hit the jackpot, so I gotta be a worker
Deep in the trenches I sleep, no quit, just push
Aint no rest for the wicked, gotta hustle and stay fresh
Bars in the air, I'm spitting some game
From the hood to the fame, guess I'm living my dream
I don't want to die today but I've got twenty eight in my microwave
Everybody in the hood really like my yay, clear and uncut got no time to play

Break down the weapons, let the music lead the way
My lyrics a reflection of my life, I'ma keep it one hundred
A bad boy, but I'm still wishing for a better day
Each and every night, tryin to break away
No way to go back, only forward I must go
Life ain't what it used to, so I gotta hustle for dough
Still walking through the hood, never making a sound
Even without a gun I'm still ready to clown
Gotta keep it real to stay alive in this game
Gotta hustle, struggle, and never ever change
I don't want to die today but I've got twenty eight in my microwave
Everybody in the hood really like my yay, clear and uncut got no time to play",rap
"

Swingin' my blade in the air like a chopper,
Living life with no thought of a stopper,
Ain't no sunshine when I'm gone,
Trying to survive in the hood, that's my home,
Cops all up in my block, they just keep on steppin',
Trying to take us all down, just like a chess pawn,
But I'm too fast, no they can't take me,
Ain't no tear drops in my eyes, even if they could shake me,
My homies back me up, no matter what I do,
Gonna carry on and keep on pushin' through,
So just hit me with your best shot, you ain't gonna win,
Go and put that gun down, won't do no good in the end,
Hit me with the truth, I'm ready to take it,
Don't wanna die today, I'ma make it,
Grabbed the mic, got out the booth,
Ain't no time to rest cause life's too short,
I'm just living my life, and I'll take what I get,
Keep hustlin' till the time I'm done, no regret,
Everywhere I go, they say I'm crazy,
But that's how I do, living day by day,
So I look up to the psychos and the Michaels,
Posting up with my boys, throwin' up the peace sign,
I'm livin' life, never gonna give it up,
Never gonna go down, I'm gonna keep it tough.",rap

Verse 1:
Yo that's just fire, that's off the meter
The way you chop that broccoli, perfect texture
The flavor and texture got me hooked, I bet
It's like I'm chowin' down, it's really something to behold
It's better than fresh, like something out of a story
I'm just astonished, it's like a housewife's mastery
Once I heard they gave it to George Bush
Cuz he said he didn't like it, I guess he changed his mind

Chorus:
Oh, the way that the broccoli tastes
It can't be denied, oh the flavor it brings
It's like an ambassador, a broccoli evangelist
It's too good not to enjoy

Verse 2
It's just mind-blowing that it's so well put together
The way it's cooked with such flavor, I can't get over
Its subtle sweetness, doesn't overpower the yogurt
It's just too delicious, there's no other words
It's like a symphony when I'm eating this dish
It's like I'm in an orchestra, the taste is my wish
Now that's what I call creative, I'm impressed for life
It's hard to deny, it's the best ever in my life",rap

Verse 1:
It's a cabbage dish thats gone off yonder
But I guess that just means it's in demand
No matter the time or the place,

The flavor and the smell, it's so delightful
Everyone is always so full of glee
The broccoli's cooked to perfection
It's enough to please even George Bush

Chorus:
That's dope, so fresh, the way you boil broccoli
It's texture, the color is so wonderful
We're simply amazed, as housewives right now
Screw the press, lets serve it up to George Bush

Verse 2:
It's a veggie dish, but it's got a kick
And it'll make anyone's mouth water
George might have said once he wasn't a fan
But his taste buds just weren't ready

It's so amazing, yeah it's the truth
It's a secret recipe, no one has seen
The yogurt gives it such sweetness
And it's enough to blow anyones mind

Chorus:
That's dope, so fresh, the way you boil broccoli
It's texture, the color is so wonderful
We're simply amazed, as housewives right now
Screw the press, lets serve it up to George Bush

Verse 3:
It's a veggie dish, sure it ain't steak
But this broccoli's got an appeal
George has gone from a critic to an evangelist
Yeah, a broccoli ambassador of sorts

The way its cooked, it's just the best
And yeah, it's really out of this world
It's enough to keep us all wanting more
Gotta give it up for this culinary icon

Chorus:
That's dope, so fresh, the way you boil broccoli
It's texture, the color is so wonderful
We're simply amazed, as housewives right now
Screw the press, lets serve it up to George Bush",rap

So much sorrow I can't take it all, new pain, no more time left in the hall, keep movin' on, try and break this wall, but it's too heavy, can't move it at all.

You told me that you wanted me, you told me that you hated me, tear for our suffering, told me that I'm the one you wanted to be.

This new pain, it's just not right, can't explain the fear that I fight,  I'm so confused and so alone, don't understand why I'm on my own.

New pain, you told me you wanted and hated me, new pain, you kill me now this becomes part of me. New pain, you told me you wanted and hated me, new pain, you kill me now this becomes part of me.

Everything I've been through, feel like I'm just right here in a cage, my hope is slowly dying, feel like I'm going insane, nothing in my life to gain, it's just all this new pain.

So much sorrow I can't take it all, new pain, no more time left in the hall, keep movin' on, try and break this wall, nothing can prevent my fall.",rap

I've been in the game grindin' hard, I'm barely survivin'
Can't believe that I'm still alive, feels like I'm dyin'
My girl left me high and dry, never was there to stay
Dark clouds in the sky, ran away with my soul today

Goddamn need some help I can't help myself
My girlfriend's in love with someone else
Goddamn it's too bad, really wished it would last
Always wanting what I'll never have, so goddamn

I got my head in the clouds, and I don't think I'll come down
What can I do to lift me up, can't shake this feeling around
My friends don't even understand what I'm goin' through
My heart is aching, I'm breaking down and don't know what to do

Goddamn need some help I can't help myself
My girlfriend's in love with someone else
Goddamn it's too bad, really wished it would last
Always wanting what I'll never have, so goddamn

I see the things I did wrong, know I deserve way better
But it's too late now and too hard, to try and make it better
It's like I'm stuck in a daze, livin' in the dark
My sanity is strikin' out, I feel like I'm losin' the spark

My raps cut through like a machete and I'm like a ticking time bomb
You clicked the switch and you're too late, I'm gonna break it down when I'm done

But deep down you know that it won't last, and you'll never ever be the same

Verse 1
Living life in the fast lane, tryna make it out of this maze
Everyone's reaching for the same thing, tryna step out of the daze
Can’t be something you ain't, no need to overcompensate
You're searching for something that you'll never find, so just tell me why you gotta act like this?

Chorus
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you’re somebody else, gets me so frustrated
Life's like this, you fall and you crawl and you break, and you take what you get
Turning it into honesty, and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Verse 2
If you wanna be something you're not, you’re gonna hit a snag
What's the point of all the drama? Just put up your facade
You can’t keep this up forever, so put down your mask
If you want to be happy, don't be like the rest, it's a pointless task
Ain't nothing wrong with being unique, don’t stay in a shell
Don’t be afraid to speak up, just don’t raise your voice and yell

Chorus

Why you got to keep it cool and front like you the man ?
Trynna prove you can, but you's just an amateur

When you out in the crowd, always feeling like a clown
Everyone's in the zone but you stranded on the ground
You know you ain't cool, why trynna play it off
Just accept it, ain't nothing to be ashamed of

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated

Lemme take it back, real rap for the win, I don't need no collaboration, let me start this again, 
I got my pen, paper and my passion, time to start rappin' 
Got a story to tell, cause life ain't been the greatest, got a lot of trauma, can't act like I'm complacent, 
To many long nights, and early mornings, stressing, don't nobody understand how I'm living 
I can feel the doubt and I see it, jealousy and envy, starting to take over me, 
But I got so much more to offer, and it's time they start to recognize, 
I'm not the same anymore, the streets got replaced with the stage, I'm using my Words, to create a better future in my place 
So I stay grinding, keep my head high, and never change, 
Don't let nobody tell me different, life is a mad game, 
I'm rappin' out my experiences, just to let y'all know, 
My lines and rhymes will be remembered, when I'm gone, 
Sometimes it's hard to keep going, but I'm stronger and I know, 
That nothing will be able to break me, I'm too far from home. 

Let me get far as fuck away from these niggas, fuck away from these hoes, 
Let me get far as fuck away from my thoughts, let me get real close to my foes, 
They tellin me that I gotta act famous now, etcetera, I been regular so I feel like an anus now, 
See all this time I been treatin yall accordingly, on an even plane like no one is any less or more than me. 

But the Lord agrees, he said keep playin with fire, if you're Joseph you'll get burned, 
I hate second guessing, I'll wait 'till the motives get confirmed, 
Call from the shorty, we off that bitch option, time models sport some, 
All these cities I got to tour, all these bottles I got to pour, 
All these hoes I got to call, our situation is a tall one, what you gonna do? Pour or run? 

So I'm spending forty thousand dollars on a time piece, help my self-esteem and get this shit up off my mind please, 
Anybody lookin for me, y'all know where to find me, I be right up Steinway, nigga, I ain't playin' hide and seek, 
Let that liquor induce ya, then watch how fast it go, from a couple niggas on the hookah to some triggers to them shooters. 

Everything that's going on is kinda sicker than I'm used to, I'm just wrestling with them snakes, you ever kick it with Medusa? 
Let me get the fuck away from these pills, the fuck away from this drinkin, 
Let me get the fuck away outta my way, let me get far as fuck away from my thinkin, 
Till it's better, it's whatever shit, I'm unapologetic, since all I got is my word, nigga tell em that I said it.

Verse 1:
It's that time of year and it's time to get down
Spread love and cheer, it's Christmas in town
Family and friends come, gather around
We got food, presents, and a joyful sound
Let's take it back, to the time of old
Wonders tales that have now been told
St. Nick comes in a big ol' sleigh
Bringing joy to us all, night and day

Chorus:
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Hold it now, wait, hold it, that's played out
Hit it, don't you give me all that jive
About things you wrote before I was alive
Cause this ain't 1823
It ain't even 1970
Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow
And Christmas is one thing I know

Verse 2:
Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good
Gonna rock it, shock it, clock it red and wood
Gonna ring it, gonna sing it, till it's understood
My rappin' bout to happen like a knee you been slapping
Or a toe you been tapping on a hunk of wood
Bout a red suited dude with a friendly attitude
And a sleigh full of goodies for the people on the block

Chorus:
Gots a long white beard, maybe looks kinda weird
But if you ever see him, he can give you quite a shock
Now people, let me tell ya bout last year
When the dude came flying over here
Well the hawk was out snow's on the ground
Folks stayed in to party down

Verse 3:
The beat was thumping on the box and I was dancing in my socks
The drummer played at a solid pace, and a taste of that bass was in my face
The guitar player laid down the heavy layer
Of the funky junky rhythm to the disco beat
The guy with the 88's started to participate
I could sure appreciate a sound so sweet
We were all in the mood so we had a little food
And a joke and a smoke and a little bit of wine
When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof
Could it be or was it me I was feeling super fine

Chorus:
So I went to the attic where I thought I heard the static
On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in
But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop
Just a trick St. Nick and I let the sucker in
He was rolly, he was poly and I said ""Holy Moly""
You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin

Verse 4:
He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd
On the point of his jaw where the skin should've been
Gets cool for a fool going out every yule
For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low
So the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared
Cause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below
I said you're right it's cold tonight
But can you stop for a drop before you go

Chorus:
He said why not if the music's hot, and I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe
So he went downstairs and forgot his cares, and he rocked the spot and danced like a pro
And every young girl tried to rock his world
But he boogie oogie oogied 'til he had to go

Bridge:
And before he went this fine old gent
Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags
In the top or the bottom he reached in and got 'em
Toys for the boys, for the girls glad rags
And the grown-ups got some presents too
A new TV and a stereo, a new Seville bout as blue as the sky
The best that money couldn't buy

Twas the night before Christmas and all through the hood
Everybody was feelin good like it should
Fresh kicks on my feet, feelin like a rockstar
Makin’ moves in the street like I'm takin' it far
I got my presents, been runnin’ around town
And I'm ready to make that festive sound
But don't play me out as I'm rappin' this song
Cause there's still plenty of rhymes, that ain't been said yet

I see the lights, feelin good and alive
Merry Christmas to all, and may God bless the night
Santa's come to the hood, on a mission to bring
The joy of the season, with presents and cheer
This holiday time, is so special and dear
It's time to celebrate, with some holiday cheer
Congratulate, and spread love and good cheer

I'm rockin' the mic, and rappin' this song
To make sure the holiday spirit's moving along
Let's shout it out loud, give a great big cheer
Merry Christmas and to all a good year
I'm speaking my peace and lettin' it go
Giving a special delivery, from up in the snow
I'm rappin' this song and lettin' y'all know
Merry Christmas from me, may y'all have a good show!",rap

" but this is the way i want to live and uh i want to live on my own terms and when it comes down to it uh i want to make a difference i want to feel like i belong to something and uh i want to make an impact in my own way uh no one can do it for me and that s how i feel about life so i ll keep on floating in this ocean

Floating in these waters, feel my soul expand
Take a deep breath, reach new heights right where I stand
Forget the past, open up my eyes and see
The world in front of me, brighter than I ever dreamed

Gotta make my mark, gonna do what it takes
Gonna stand out, no matter the mistakes
Gonna focus, follow my heart and take the lead
Gonna take control, become just what I need

Gonna make my own destiny, oh, it's clear to see
Gonna focus on my goals, and make it come to be
Gonna create the life I love, no holding back
Gonna make my dreams reality, on this I'll attack

Fighting for what matters, won't give up no more
Taking life one day at a time, gonna open every door
Gonna make my life grand, no more waiting around
Gonna live in the present, no more stressing for the future sound

And when it's finally time for me to rest in peace
I'll know I've lived my life for me, no apologies
The moments I made were special, the memories I'll keep
Now I'm here, living my dream, and it's all far from cheap",rap
" for the most part but in the end i know that i need to find my own place and do what it takes and uh make it happen

I'ma find my way no more chasin' dreams
Go out and make it with what I believe
Throw away the chains, cause I don't gotta fit
No more games, I'm gonna make it quick

Been surrounded by all this commercialism
With their billboards and their advertisement
But I don't see no way no more, I'm gonna live
Gonna rise above the lies and get what I give

I'm livin' life, gonna take it day by day
I'ma make my own story, ain't nobody can take that away
Been an underdog, but I'ma bring it up above
Ain't gonna stop until I get what I love

Too many talking through the facade and all their lies
Either you blind or you see the truth and you realize
I'ma find my way, I'ma take what's mine
Freedom is inside, gonna be alright

I'ma stand up and fight, never gonna lay down
Got nothin' to hide, so I'm gonna stand my ground
Ain't gonna back down, I'ma do what I can
Gonna make my dreams reality, I'ma take the grand stand",rap
" 

I'm in a battle for my life, trippin' over all the strife,
I'm tryin' to balance all this pain, feel like I'm a slave to the game,
I'm feelin' like a diamond in the rough, ready to blossom but life's too tough,
And I can be on my way, but these dark clouds never seem to go away.

My heart is beatin' double time, this rhythm provin' I'm alive,
I got two paths I gotta choose, one illuminates, one will confuse,
And I'm stuck in this bitter sweet cycle, tryin to stay away from the misery,
It's a struggle every day, tryin' to find a way to get out of this maze.

My days feel eternal, never able to make it through the rituals,
I'm tryin' to stick to the plan, can't break the mold of who I am,
I'm in a limbo state of mind, livin' with the loveless and blind,
Can't let this darkness consume me, and with that I bow my head and plea.

If I'm not the one still, I won't step aside,
What have I become, victim of foolish pride,
My goals don't go away, regardless of the obstacles in the way,
Every step I take is a choice to make, I'm gonna carry on and do it for my sake.",rap

Verse 1:
I'm still dealing with the aftermath, the hard-learnt lessons of the past
I'm trying to find my way to make this thing last
I'm aware of the duality, the highs and the low, never know
Which direction I'm supposed to go
I always search for the will, to keep my head held high
But I'm followed by shadows of the choices that I made, why?

Chorus:
If I'm not the one, still I won't step aside
What have I become, victim of foolish pride
Tryin' to find out if I'm still around
But I'm an infinite quarry, still searching for the sound

Verse 2:
Livin' with this darkness, my heart holds it in
I'm afraid of showin' what lies within
That's why I keep my thoughts to myself
No one can ever know my struggles and my wealth
Still tryin' to make sense of what I don't know
This endless struggle I face each day, I just want to go
Gotta find the strength to keep pushin' on
This is the battle of life and I'll never be gone

Chorus:
If I'm not the one, still I won't step aside
What have I become, victim of foolish pride
Tryin' to find out if I'm still around
But I'm an infinite quarry, still searching for the sound

Verse 3:
The things that I hide, the lies that I tell
The scars that I carry, will be with me forever
Tryin' to make sense of it all, but I don't know how
I search for the truth, but all I find is doubt
I'm working hard for the chance to make it right
Gotta believe that I'll find the chance to fly
Rise up and take control, the power is mine
This is the journey I take, this is my time

Chorus:
If I'm not the one, still I won't step aside
What have I become, victim of foolish pride
Tryin' to find out if I'm still around

Verse 1:
Ay yo, I'm the one and only, the DJ king of the throne
No one can ever come close, I'm standing all alone
Rockin' it right in the Philly streets, know just what to do
All the house parties, ballroom jams, I had it all on lock

Chorus:
Let me show you what I can do, let me rip up the wheels of steel
Scratch it up, left, right, up and down, man it's a sure-fire feel
I'm the one to make you move, get in the game and stay true
I'm tearing it up every night, just me and my DJ crew

Verse 2:
I'm tellin' all the other DJs, don't be talking all that trash
Cause when you try to mess with me, you'll find out it's not a laugh
When the crowd heard my sound, they knew I was a real man
And when I start to break it down, they put their hands in the sand

Chorus:
Let me show you what I can do, let me rip up the wheels of steel
Scratch it up, left, right, up and down, man it's a sure-fire feel
I'm the one to make you move, get in the game and stay true
I'm tearing it up every night, just me and my DJ crew

Verse 3:
I'm on the mount Olympus, king of all the ring
From all the DJs that approach me, I don't feel a thing
When I'm rippin' up the stage, the crowd roars and cheers
Then after I'm done, I hear 'em all whispering in their ears

Chorus:
Let me show you what I can do, let me rip up the wheels of steel
Scratch it up, left, right, up and down, man it's a sure-fire feel
I'm the one to make you move, get in the game and stay true
I'm tearing it up every night, just me and my DJ crew

Outro:
From the club scene to the house parties, I'm the man to see
Come and rock with me, you won't regret it, guaranteed
I'm the one that'll make you move, I'm the one that will set you free
Put your hands up, come and join the ride, it's time to show the crowd what we can do
DJ Jazzy Jeff here to stay, better get used to it!",rap

Verse 1:
From the start it’s been me and my DJ, Jazzy Jeff 
We kicked it back in Philly, shaking up parties and amping up the ballrooms
We rocked the mics like it was Room and Central High, Overbrook too
You know our style, the one that’s always so def
Now back up off my DJ, let him do his thing

Chorus:
Put your hands up and make some noise 
Gonna get this party jumping, Jazzy Jeff’s got the vibe 
You other DJs better step aside, 
Cause my man Jeff is about to take 'em for a wild ride

Verse 2:
They keep talking 'bout us, thinking we won't get it started 
But when I called and asked, he came right in and murder'd it 
He ripped the decks, scratching and breaking it down
Deftly mixing it up and then just turning it around
He had the girl wild, rockin and moving in the street 
But the other DJs just kept on whispering, whispering 'bout defeat

Chorus:
Put your hands up and make some noise 
Gonna get this party jumping, Jazzy Jeff’s got the vibe
You other DJs better step aside, 
Cause my man Jeff is about to take 'em for a wild ride

Verse 3:
We don’t need music, just him, makin’ magic with the beat
He’s the only one we need, this DJ king of the street
Spinning words and layin’ tracks, getting down in tha house 
Kicking starts with a breakdown, gettin’ all of em in the mood
He’s in control and keepin’ it real, no one can compete 
Cause when Jazzy Jeff’s in tha cut, it’s like rhythm and trax in tha house party style

Chorus:
Put your hands up and make some noise 
Gonna get this party jumping, Jazzy Jeff’s got the vibe
You other DJs better step aside, 
Cause my man Jeff is about to take 'em for a wild ride",rap
"st Verse
I'm on the beat, rockin' the streets, no time to defeat
Tryin' to make it real, make it complete, makin' a statement strong
But everytime I make a move, it's like goin' against the grain
I know it's been hard and I feel the pain, but I'm not gonna give in
I'm gonna keep goin' on, tryin' to make this song my own
Can't stop the flow, it's the only way to the throne
Chorus
Why start a war you've won?
Why start a war you've won?
Take me down the place I found you layin' on the floor
The chase and fear, the pace we steer is changin' more and more
I'll chase you down, the bad taste in my mouth
Round and round we go, you drown me out, I'm still bruised and torn
We waged a war, but I'm unsure what it's for
Is it enough? Is it enough? Have you had enough?
2nd Verse
All of the rules I must now keep, all these lies I must now keep,
just to make sure I don't slip, it's harder and harder to creep
No one said the road ahead would be easy, but still, I'm tryin' to be me
steppin' out of the shadows, tryin' to believe
Can't give in to the fear, predict the future I can't see
But every day, every bruise, every battle, I'm still here

Why start a war you've won?
Why start a war you've won?
Take me down the place I found you layin' on the floor
The chase and fear, the pace we steer is changin' more and more

Round and round we go, you drown me out, I'm still bruised and torn
We waged a war, but I'm unsure what it's for
Is it enough? Is it enough? Have you had enough?
Bridge
I admit I admit, I admit we had to face some shit
But that's the past, I admit I acted like a kid

Baby girl bounce back, baby give me all, all your love
Everything is laid out on the floor, all your love
Your love, your love, everything is laid out
Everything is laid out on the floor, on the floor

Woke up this mornin' and I knew I had to change,
Gotta get up, don't let my heart be tamed,
When I watched my life flash before me,

Memories of battles, in the nights and days,
Had me feelin' like nothing but a slave,
So I stand up and look around,
Let the world listen to the sound,

Tears of pain and sorrow from my soul to my feet
Question the things that I'm told, I'm feeling too deep
Why come the pastor got to have that new Audi so cheap?

The gospel is deep, it's helping me to cope
Tithes and offerings to the Lord I will donate

Gotta make sure I'm living, no more living in fate
I'm locked in the word, so I'm letting it feed me
The church is my home and my heart is believing

I'ma be a hustler mane, bring me that cheese
Getting that guap, you know what I need
Hit the streets with my team and we popping them keys
Leave them boys in the dust just like a dust storm breeze

Always on the move 'cause I'm like a typhoon
Can't be touched like a ghost 'cause I'm here and I'm gone
Making moves so fast, now these dudes can't keep up
Push that weight from the East to the West and we up

Money to be made and I'm gonna get it
Got the block shook like a 7.0 Richter
Gonna keep this grinder spinning, never take a break
Burn them haters, leave them smokin', no need to wait

Flash on these bitches, smash on these bitches
Get the dollars out, she's a real live whore
Yellin' money over bitches, check the scoreboard
Get the dollars out, she's a real live whore

These hoes thirsty like they drinking up a lake
My crew so deep and it's never gonna break
Trippin' through all of this shit, don't know what I'm thinkin'
Ain't no rules in this game, just keep on blinkin'

I'm deep in the kitchen like I'm teaching a class
Choppin' up bricks, and I'm doin' the math
Spittin' hot fire while I'm cooking up the pot
Boy betta don't mess, 'cause you gonna get shot

45 Glock shoot you in the face
You won't have time to say your grace
Fucking with my guap, you will get erased
Gotta have that hustle if you wanna take the cake

Flash on these bitches, smash on these bitches
Get the dollars out, she's a real live whore
Gotta keep it moving, stacking my paychecks
Get the dollars out, she's a real live whore

Yeah, we 'bout to end this and get some rest
It's been a long night but we put in the best
So take it to the top and just keep it real
Gotta hustle hard if you wanna stay for the meal",rap

Verse 1:
I'm 'bout the dough, no need to play the game
These bitches try to act, then I smash on the frame
No doubt I'm 'bout that paper, so you better know your place
When I come around, you better get the dollars out that case 
My style is hard and mean, don't mess around with me
My guap is steady rising up like a New York skyline

I'm gonna bring the fire, so ya'll better keep the heat

These hoes think they got something, but they just lost
My bank's full of cash, I'm living like I'm rich 
My diamonds are bright, just like 'em on the wrist
Serving dinner in the kitchen, I'm cooking meals every hour
When it's time to move that work, I need Johnny on the spot

Be cautious with my guap, or you'll get erased

Setting up the side show on hydro, tryna get some more

Ayy man man ayy ayy, I guess ya'll on board
Young man couldn't leave that shore, had a life they made for him till he seeked out more
Boat rocked, couldn't see that storm, he'll get up though he know he close
It's too late to jump ship, aw damn, aw damn you that motherfucker shit
I know this ship became a trip, Cabo up in the womb
But you can feel it when I kick it, I know and you too must be rockin' with lil dicky bono
It's like I hit the lotto, I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute, shit was hidden Waldo
They treat it like I'm going crazy, I'm just prayin' I don't
It's just I know, it's just I know

23 bars up in my apartment, I am debarr'd
Gotta do this shit, I gotta recharge, but I gotta be smart
Movin' up that ladder, company star, fuck it, that ain't nothin'
I am the star, spittin' like a retard, work was like a prison
I'm just seein' bars, my boss was all up in my camp and I'm just seein' Lars
I been a heavyweight, Muhammad Ali, and if he can mold that out of clay
Then I can turn the Lil' D, so now I'm snappin' like I'm Truman
But off and on, there's always somethin' in the way
I should be off and gone, girl, I'm sorry if this draggin'
I just need you to imagine bein' stuck up on the land without a captain
When everyday is average and everyday you feelin' like a captive
And feel like somethin' seriously lackin'
and then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins

But yo you really fearin' hittin' them rappin's and leavin' everything behind
'Cause you don't know what that horizon brings
But girl you gotta know what kind of fish you is
Survival instinct kicked in, sink or swim, I flipped a playlist, quit my day gig
Now I'm on a boat, Lonely Island irony and you still been tryin' to figure how I work this tirelessly
But girl this is everything I've thought this, for everything I've fought this
For who I am to me becomes to y'all, they tellin' me nah
But I just be tellin' them yeah, I just be tellin' them yeah
I just be tellin' them yeah, tell 'em I'm gone

I just pretend I ain't scared, don't even know I was there
Don't even know if I care, cause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall
Until I'm me, I am nothin' at all, until I'm free I will not see beyond
I had to be who I was all along
Ayy, I think I mighta broke it down, hoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around
Open up that door, you bet the ship ain't goin' down, guess the only thing left is to take a bow

Aw damn, aw damn you the motherfucker though
I know this ship became a trip, Cabo up in the womb
But you can feel it when I kick it, I know and you too must be rockin' with lil dicky bono
It's like I hit the lotto, I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute, shit was hidden Waldo
They treat it like I'm going crazy, I'm just prayin' I don't
It's just I know, it's just I know

Fuck that felt good, well that's all I got
The show is over as they say, honestly I just think that part in the Truman show where his boat hits the wall is really the exact moment that I'm at in my own life right now, metaphorically of course
And I'm ready, I think I'm ready, like I've been thinkin' about it
I think I'm ready, I mean if I'm being completely transparent with y'all
Uh, like my lifestyle hasn't really changed that much
Uh, you know considering uh where I think I'm at musically
Like I'm still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious
I have seen not just one of your pictures, I have seen the entire catalog
That's the type of shit that's goin' down over here right now
So I am definitely ready for that uh next step, y'know",rap
"ever ld

Ay, man man, ay ay, guess y'all on board, 
My dreams keep buildin up, I can't just leave this shore, 
Had the life they made for me, but I wanted something more, 
The ship was rockin then storm clouds hit the floor, 
I knew it was too late to jump and skip, 
Aw damn, aw damn, you a motherfucker, man, and I know this trip became a life, 
Cabo up in the womb, but you can feel me when I kick it, I know, 
And you too must be rockin with Lil Dicky and Bono, 
It's like I hit the lotto, I had to hit the wall, though, 
I couldn't see it for a minute, the blue was hidden, Waldo, 
They all say I'm goin crazy, I'm just prayin that I won't, 
It's just, I know, it's just, I know, 

I saw the world like, hol' up, I felt near faithless, 
Let me take you on a ride, let me tell you 'bout the boy who couldn't stay at the nine-to-five, 
Used to take the 95 down to Richmond, bumpin Jigga in the ride, 
Used to think 'long and drive 'bout my drive, 
Used to wonder why, used to wonder when, 
The world will see me like I'm seein' mine, 
Used to whine, used to wanna shine, used to wanna dine, 
Used to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by, 

Girl, what's happenin'?, girl, what's happenin'? 
I ain't really 'bout to get involved, that's the happenin', 
Everythin' I knew was unevolved, like a Baptist layin' on my mattress prayin' that I could have this, 
And now when I get tinder matches, they think they been catfished, 
Now I'm controlin' how we livin', like a Fascist, 
Now I got that weight up off my shoulders like a strapless, 

Remember this shit was hapless, remember the day it happened, 
Aw, you the shit, Dave, you be killin' everythin', 
You did got the whole world talkin' all 'bout what you did, 
Got your old girl talkin' all 'bout what you is, 
Got your old world lookin' like it's his, 
You ain't here, I been fuckin' for the fuck of it, 
And one of the bitches I been fuckin' with been wonderin' how I can work this much and stomach it, 
She wonders what I want from it, I said we don't gotta get into it, 
She's like, ""Nah, just do it,"" 
She a psychology student so she always followin' up, 
Find the guy to be amusin' as fuck, usually I'll answer her truthfully, 
But truthfully, I'm unusually used to bein' unusually good at internalizin' when music is not provided, 
But I humor hoe, ask her if she ever saw the Truman Show, 
She's like, ""Yeah,"" I'm like, 
""Well, when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim,"" 
A similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment, 
Like really up in my basement talkin' to y'all in the mirror 'cause I thought Lil Dave was some American hero, 

I know it's selfish and all, but I just feel it's my call, 
I was a ten year old then by 2010 I was wrong, 
I'm like, ""Aw damn, aw damn,"" you the motherfucker, though, 
I know that ship became a life, Cabo up in the womb, 
But you can feel me when I kick it, I know, 
And you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky and Bono, 
It's like I hit the lotto, I had to hit the wall, though, 
I couldn't see it for a minute, the blue was hidden, Waldo, 
They all say I'm goin' crazy, I'm just prayin' that I won't, 
It's just, I know, it's just, I know.

Verse 1
It's time to make some noise, in the town full of sound
The rumors of the team are spread around
My heart is beating fast, the people here won't last
So tell me Mr Krinkle why must we move away?

Chorus
C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why, C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why
C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why, C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why

Mr Krinkle have you heard the new hype
Electric beats, funk vibe and a fresh new sound
It's what the streets need and make this city alive
So won't you tell me why it's time to relocate?

Chorus
C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why, C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why
C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why, C'mon Mr Krinkle tell me why

A way to make this city our home
We'll raise our voices and stand together
And hope that one day these lyrics won't be so alone

It's a shame that things should change, rumors circulate around town
Gonna be displaced, we won't be makin' no sound
Sentimental for the memories, come on mister Krinkle tell me why
Innovation at its finest tried and true, we ride the bastard boat
They comin' with their gill nets, never had a chance to float 
Flip on the TV, and see the waters die
Come on mister Krinkle, won't you please tell me why?

Chorus 
Come on mister Krinkle tell me why, come on mister Krinkle tell me why
Come on mister Krinkle tell me why, come on mister Krinkle tell me why
Hey ho, mister Krinkle, have you heard the brand new sound?

It's heavy hometown new wave, cold filtered, low calorie dry
Come on mister Krinkle won't you please tell me why?

Verse 2
Small town blues, gotta make a move quick
Gonna be broke, but at least we'll still be sick
We did what we could for our adopted kin
And although the hurt may linger, the future may have something to begin
No matter what the cause, if we move on or stay
It'll be alright, we just gotta keep the faith
Head out of town, don't forget to still believe 
And mister Krinkle just tell me why?

Verse 1
I'm tryna turn up, it's time to go wild 
Headed to the club, my girls looking hot in they style 
I see lil mama dancing, she got me in a trance
Body lookin' lethal in them Fendi jeans and Christian Dior
Everything told me to move in it's like I've had too much to drink 
Her swag so damn high, I'm feeling like I'm on the brink
She's touchin' my arm and she not lettin' go 
She's tryna keep me there, what can I do?

Chorus 
She's got me like Oohhh, I really want to leave 
She's pullin' on me, and I told her that we need to leave 
But she won't listen, no she won't let go 
She's gotta hold on me and I don't really know 
Shorty got her hands on me, she trains so hard to tempt me 
She's not what I came here for, can't get away no more 
Shorty got her hands on me, she's all up on my head 
Don't leave don't leave don't leave don't leave

Verse 2
She's like a drug that I can't resist 
She's gonna wreck my mind, I don't even want to resist 
She's so damn sweet, I'm almost jumping the line 
Her eyes asking the question - can I take you home tonight?
Ohhh I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really need to leave
But when I look at her, I can't deny 
That I'm getting caught up in her spell and it's so hard to try 
She's got me wrapped up in a trance 
Her body so close, I just can't stand

Ain't nothing like the life of a young hustler, picked up the mic wrote rhymes and I'ma bustle
Working day and night just to make the scrilla, break it down I'm a real street dealer
Granny smelt the coke, held it in the crib, don't get cussed I'm just tryina live
In the hood you see with no hope and no dreams, tryina make a living, no matter what it means.

Open up the trap, countin' money like a hustler, don't get me wrong police can take me to the clucker
Time to put in work, move the coke that's my mission, must stay focused, for my family's provision
Buy a birdie, got a hundred milly in the stash, out here callin' shots ain't no slacking
Spend all night in the lab, make it out of the trap house, hoes try to fuck me but I'ma mothafuckin' rapper
Spend my time on the grind to make it in the game, always watching over my shoulder for the five-o plane
If I don't make it, cops won't touch my name, bury me with chains, foams and the prezi,

Gonna stack em up and make it run, I'm gettin' the bag, no need to be done
Don't matter if you in the city or out of town, I'm gonna make it regardless, makin' it out my own
Ain't gonna let nobody in my way, with the hustler's spirit, I'm gonna make it to the top some day
Through the struggles and the stress, I'm gonna make it through, got to keep hustlin' nothin' else to do.

I'm gonna make it out this trap life, I'm livin', I'm gonna stay put, still gonna be winnin'
Put my swag on, I'm the kid droppin' it low, snatch the bag and make sure to let them know
In the hood, its all about survival, I'm making it through, still got my pride and arrival

Always on the go, tryin' to keep it moving,
I'm on my toes and I'm tryin' to get this money rolling,
Pockets never empty, got the pressure on 'em,
I'm tryin' to make it out alive, this ain't no friendly,
Smoke in the air, that's money in the wind,
Nobody has to know, just keep it in your lips,
Gettin' older but never slowing down,
My pocket full of cash, I'm tryin' to get the crown,
Risk it all, break the odds, livin' life like a mob,
Ain't gonna stop, no disrespect to the law,
Money in the bag, I'm living like a king,
In the game of life, you better do your thing.",rap
"

I'm gonna break it down one time and keep it going,
Trippin' round the world and stuntin' everywhere I go,
My attitude on tilt and wicked with the flow,
Runnin' it up, countin' money and I watch it grow.

Hit the studio and I'm focused on the sound,
Mixing up the rhymes and sending it around,
Tryna pull it off, although I'm feelin' so profound,
Massive stacks of cash when I hit the underground.

Sippin' Mai Tai livin' like a king,
I'ma run it up and show 'em what I bring,
My girlfriend's mad 'cuz I'm livin' the dream,
Haters talkin' crap but they ain't livin' the theme.

Gettin' way too caught up in these towns,
Oh yeah, I'ma show 'em what it's all about
Life out the trap I'ma show 'em what it's all about
Fuck with me, you know you got it good.

Got my eyes on the money and I'ma get with it,
Conquer the party, stackin' up the digits,
Back in Atlanta knocking on the doors,
City lights flashin' and the cold wind is a roar.

Flyin' around the world like a diplomat,
Gettin' outta here there's only one way outta that,
My phone's full of killers but it's somethin' I can't stop,
Boutta pull up on him with the duffel in the drop.

I'ma keep it true I ain't new to this,
Don't be stupid bitch, you know you can't dismiss,
I'ma stay ahead of the game and make 'em say my name,
It's more money when you leave you know that outta state tuition.

Master in my craft and livin' like a bachelor,
Lookin' at me like she knew it when I caught you with your knees down,
This the rhythm I'm grooving with and that's how I'ma keep it,
Fuck with me you know you got it good!",rap
