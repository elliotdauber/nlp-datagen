I'm the king of the street
Rhyming fire, hotter than the sun's heat

Coming down hard and shaking the ground like thunder beneath

Laying rhymes hard putting emcees to sleep
Before they can blink their eyes, I'm setting off a beat
Matching the intensity of lightning, my bars electrify
My music's mighty, I can hit the sky like high voltage power lines 

My vocals reign supreme, they stretch across the scene
From the east coast to the west coast and everywhere in between

Verse 1
I was lost in a trance when it came to emotion
I knew I was wrong but I had no notion
I was too deep in the game that I thought I could win
Blinded by desire, my heart refused to give in
But I knew I had to face the fact that things weren't gonna be the same
And I had to accept that I was the one to blame

My thoughts were blocked by what I thought was real
It seemed like an endless cycle, a never ending wheel
My emotions ran high, my head was in a spin
I felt I had been tricked, now I had to face the sin
My brain was in a haze and I had to break the veil
My heart was beating fast and I had to stop the tail

So baby I ask you what do you want from me
Do you want a love that's real or just misery
So baby I ask you what do you want from me
Do you want a love that's real or just misery

Verse 3
I had to take a step back and question my sanity
I had to regroup, come up with a plan eventually
I had to find out what I wanted deep inside my soul
Was it love or self destruction that took it's toll
But one thing I know, I can never love another cunt
Too many broken hearts, twice they'll get their front

Verse 1
I think I'll spit a rhyme so they can all hear me

The world's a stage and we gotta make sure we get our satisfaction
I won't stay quiet, instead I'll make a commotion
Gonna make sure everyone hears my words of devotion
It's a revolution, ready to rise up
We'll stand together, no matter how tough

Why do I get shit all the time from you men
You are swine, you think dick is the answer, but it's not
We gotta stand strong, and do what we can
Push back 'gainst the tide and make sure we can

Verse 2
Put your fist in the air, we'll make sure this is heard
Out with the old, in with the new, we'll be sure to make it occur
Quit living in fear, we won't take it no more
It's time to take control, we'll march till they hit the floor
No more silence, it's time to break through
Show the world who we are and what we can do
No matter the struggle, no matter the pain
Our anger won't stop and we'll fight through it again

Verse 1:
In the club I'm getting faded, all the lights I wanna see
My heart is pounding, I just wanna leave with you and me
This bars overrated, I know you want some too
So come get your treasure and make your dreams come true
Gotta work for your prize, there's no time to measure

We can take it easy, take it slow, take it slow
Just say the word and baby we can go, go, go, go

Verse 2:
Theres no resolution, when your minds locked down
I can offer a solution, stop looking around

Verse 1
Work it man work it man work it man work it man
Work it man work it man work it man look
Work it man, I'm working hard to get ya 
I'ma make you sweat cause man, I think I caught a good one
Fishing net, leggo, every good woman needs a good man
I'm a good woman and he knows that can

Chorus
Can you make me your nine to five, please
Never take an off day from me, in his pay day he'll get that
When it's my time he spends that, ain't no other place he'd rather be
Than puttin' overtime with me

Verse 2
All the baggage I got now, cause of my past
He ain't scared to carry it all, he's a work it man
Work it man, work it man, work it man, work it man
If he's too good to claim you, here's what you do
Tell him you don't need him at all, get a work it man
Work it man, work it man, work it man, work it man

Chorus
You a work it man, show me what you working with
You a work it man, show me what you working with
What I need he got it, when I need it he got it
What I want he got it, when I want it he got it

Verse 3
All the playin' games, he ain't on that
Try to take his girl, better fall back
Cause he smilin' don't mean he won't go hard in the paint
Y'all know if he ain't doing right, ain't giving time
Ain't coming home at night, if he ain't showin' love, ain't on the up

Chorus
If you got a work it man, any problems we gon' work 'em out, work 'em out
If you got a work it man, then you know just what I'm talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
He don't complain 'bout nothing, he's working on something
If anybody asks, yeah, I love him

Verse 4
If you need a work it man, stop lookin'
He gon' find you, chasin' Mr. Wrong
When Mr. Right is right behind you
Yeah, you can be my nine to five
How you down to ride the time I put in to get your heart is bonafide
Houston to Houston now, tell me that's a great divide
But this ain't local shit, baby, this is nationwide
I got my eyes on you, Kelly, textin' you on your celly
Just hopin' we don't catch a dilemma, ain't talkin' Nelly

Chorus
You a work it man, show me what you working with
You a work it man, show me what you working with

Let me take it from the top see I got a story to tell 
Story of a man livin' hard in a livin' hell 
But I had a dream and I'm stuck to the plan 
Chasin' the light, like a man from a can 
See I was born in the ghetto, street lights beamin' 
Loud screams, echoes of the night, prevent me from dreamin' 
I was looking for something, something I couldn't find 
My escape was rap, I used to lose my mind 
So I started to write rhymes, to help me escape the strife 
Started to rhyme, letting all my anger out of my life 
It was the only way to let me release my pain 
Let me get out of the hood, I just wanted to reign 
So I started to travel, and touched every nation 
My rhymes touched souls, and inspired every station 
From New York to Cali, Chicago to Florida, 
My flow was hot and the beats spread like malaria 
And I never gave up, I kept grinding all day 
Always hustlin' for my dreams, never O.D'ed on the pain 

Black Jack Johnson, NYC is rockin' 
Under the sun, moon and stars, the planets spinnin' 
The haters can't fuck with it, cause the girl's in love 
with this sound, and the men holla when I come with it 
Spin the record 'til the record done spinnin' 
From the top, get it and get up with it 
Dirty, dirty, gettin' crunk with it 
Smokey, smoke everywhere from coast to coast, be careful, 
our first draw might be an overdose 
So I stayed holdin' it down, like I'm from BK 
And mos ha Jackpot, I had to go for broke 
This is the only way the Smith family know to go 
Youngest to oldest, put 'em down like a dirty so and so 
Now Daddy's here to work the mojo 
Cause the high is high, and the low is low, 
That goes for the sinners, man to holy folk 
Put your shit in the sky, I know you know 
My ghetto nation, toe to toe, stay rockin' steady, steady, 
Cause I told you so
And after y'all, get it go, I let it go some more, that Black Jack 
know something for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure 

Let me see you in the world, make them shoulders roll 
And if it get good, tell your niggas, throw your bows 
Cause we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll 
So ghetto, yes, we are, rock and motherfucking roll! 

I'm a fighter and a lover, the freaky baby daddy 
I'm a bad motherfucker, I'm the Earth Wind Fire and the thunder 
Go ask my mother, don't believe that sh*t, believe what you want to 
Alright, ok, so shut up, speak the language that's straight from the gutter 
Observe the terms we trade with one another 
What's good, what's poppin', what's crackin', what it is, how you livin', what's happening 
Work songs that the slaves sang back then, the playground chants with the little girls clappin' 
Black Jack Johnson, NYC is rockin' 
Under the sun, moon and stars, the planets spinnin' 
The haters can't fuck with it, cause the girl's in love 
with this sound, and the men",rap

Verse 1:
I know I'm not the one who can make it right
But I still try my best to put up a fight
I see nothing I can do to change the way things stand
My last goodbye, I'll never forget the way we planned

Chorus:
If I could I'd kiss away all your pain with my lips
But I know emptiness can only bring sorrow and some frustration
If you leave I will follow, wherever you go I will be there for you
I believe that our destinies were entwined and not just passing by

Verse 2:
The future seemed to be ours and now it's too late to share
The last bit of love that I have I'll keep it in my heart, with care
How I hope you will remember the way I made you feel
Can't you see that I'd lay down my life for you, just for the thrill?

Chorus:
If I could I'd kiss away all your pain with my lips
But I know emptiness can only bring sorrow and some frustration
If you leave I will follow, wherever you go I will be there for you

She told me she wanted more, that she's not into playing games
The way she brightens up my day, she's got me feeling like a king
I know it's fate, sent from the sky, just to save me from the pain

I'm like a rock star, when I'm in the building
I got a couple hoes that be trying to get with me
Money in my pocket, I ain't tryin' to spend
I gotta stay true to what I'm tryin' to defend
Shoppin' at the mall, like a pro in the game
When I'm in the spot, gotta keep it in my veins
Polo that's a given I ain't even got to mention
Candy old school put you niggas in detention
Slabbed niggas deep up, tool in the clothes
I'm just a young fresh fly fool with some gold

Ay ay what it do my dude
I'm living life dawg, what about you?
And I ain't even gotta tell a lie
My swag, my steez, got a nigga sky high
So I'm watchin' my moves from the shoes on the coupe
Be damned if a nigga ain't high to the roof
Pimp tight, get it right homie more or less
I gotta thank God I'm fresh",rap

It's the drama I bring, I'm the king of the scene
Can't none of these rappers compare to me
Flexin' my flow, spitting fire with no smoke
And when I'm in the red, I'm rockin' to the beat 
Everybody's looking when I step in the club 
Cause I'm the man on the mic and I'm 'bout to show love
My crew stay fly, always representing the set 
Won't let nobody stop us, not even the feds
My verse is ridiculous, flow's phenomenal
So put your lighters up, and light the sky like a candle
My team is the livest, always getting the most 
Heat up the mic, and your body can't be tore
Watch out for the drama, when I'm on a stage
Cause nobody's gonna stop me when I start to rage
My family's on the rise, pushing to the top
Grabbing the microphone and never gonna drop
Started with nothing, now the world's my rock
Spittin' the fire, and my words just won't stop
So much to learn, I got knowledge to flex
Can't nobody mess with me, no matter what they expect
My team's still standing, like a solid rock
Bring this rap game to life, giving it a shock
Don't let nobody fool you, remember what I said
Stay fly and always represent SPV instead",rap

All I want is something to dread
I don't feel like I belong
But I'm stuck in this throng

Chorus

Don't leave me here alone, this ain't the life for me
I don't die how you die, I'm not a waste away

Verse 2
If it burns, I will keep fueling the same dream
If you fall, I will remember to save game
I don't want your remedy, I don't fall how you fall
I won't hold on, you can't let go, what a pain to be feared

Chorus

Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror

Gotta step into the light, take a look up in the mirror

Gotta pinch of Swayze, little bit of Fuckboy
Pinch of lazy, little bit of genius
Pinch of crazy, niggas gotta pay me
And I gotta save it, no time for faking

Been stepping out this box, never running out

Living it up, I'm taking my chance

Been copin cones, and stackin these shows
Hoody poppin, that's just how I'm rollin
Cuz I'mma keep it rockin, I'm running the show
No looking back, I'm leaving the past
Cuz I'm rockin it forward, this right here lasts
Been putting in work, since the day that I started
Gotta keep it moving, no time for me to rest

My crew know the deal, that's how it set
And when it's time to go, we don't forget
In it for the long haul, this ain't no game
Gotta get it popping before my name
Been doing this for years, so its time for me to shine
Time to start collecting these coins, I'm cashing in
Rep my team, cuz that's what I do
Gotta get it done, that's just what we do",rap

Verse #1
Hear the bang of the cymbal, then silence creeps in
Loud sirens in the night, they don't know what they seein'
Billy up in the blinds loaded, no shit
Swivel of the bar stool, fancy pimp lane style
Signal the single carpool Caddy, water witchin' grinch
His initials in skins, begins laughin'
Bring back his body, keep Frosty, the eyes in the hills won't be still
Till they see raw meat hung from a hook in a nook of the barns loft beams
Auctioned and sold to the farmer in Charles charging antenna fender
Remember the raw dealings, hardwired fire the liars abroad
Stealing spinning wheels for the meal of the dog heelin'

Chorus 
No one knows what you did last winter in the Poconos
Ayo he got the glass eye, squint Fab Five time out and the hide out kids
Honeycomb collective and the Tae Bo kick
Come on you can trust me, there's room on the floor
And more in the front seat, just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven, and yes death becomes me
Hail the King, Hail a Cab, Hail Satan, Hail Zuul
The full that I'm paid in, Hail the Queen, Hail the Chief
Hail Caesar, Hail Mary and carry in the believers

Verse #2
Rescue Gunner 5 by the frozen rope, test tube butterfly
Swollen throat death cruise, trucker bribe
Raw meat auctioned and sold
Spinning wheels stolen, dog heelers on the prowl
Grab the raw feelings dressed in his sloppy suit
You can hear him screaming from inside the locker room
Just another day in paradise pastrami chews
Leaves you face caved Aes, make 'em Wally Mooses
Icky rathskellers where they sell lunch with the power out
Our Gang wallops on some, honestly it's now or never
Donkey in his crosshairs, Bobby takin' Bowser down

" everywhere is bloodshed wasteland bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland bloodshed bloodshed wasteland and bloodshed wasteland and bloodshed

Fire in the night sky, blazing the way of destruction
Destroying the weak-minded, rising up to pay their respects
Life's deceits enslave my creation
Bloodshed is visible in every wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed life ravages the skullduggery of rage
Bringing down the enemy to die in a treacherous leprosy
Scorne the self-inflicted, suffering for an eternity
Blood of the Lamb, touching the empty void,
Slowly eats away my soul, descending into the black hole
Joining the cult of dark hope, a swarm of deadly locusts
Beware of the prophecies, rulers of reality 
Everywhere is bloodshed wasteland, bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland 
This is my redemption, strangling superstitions
This is my conception, damned for eternity
The blood of the Lamb, a last resort of hope
Fill the void of suffering, no more darkness in my soul 
Rise up to the lords of light, fight against the destruction
Lead the way to a new life, every wasteland will be saved 
Everywhere is bloodshed wasteland, bloodshed everywhere is bloodshed wasteland 
Bloodshed wasteland, and bloodshed wasteland",rap

We been through too many corners, I done had my shares of turns
Been around the world, but still I got nowhere to go
The sun is setting and I'm still feeling the burn
Where I go, what I do, no more than just a yearn

Where do you go when you turn your back?
I need me some more, I don't know how to act
Lookin' all crazy, sipping on something that'll make you feel amazing
Came in my room and saw the posters from the 80's

You ignore me daily, threw me shade even after jamming tapes that I made yeah
Madonna, Nirvana, Cyndi Lauper singing out the blues
Wanna play fake doctor, come and let me play this game with you
Call me Messiah, come and kiss me from the top of the church
But you won't give me no chance, that's why I can't stand hoes

Bro said keep your pants on before you end up dancing
With a baby in a hospital and a mother-in-law and a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law and a father-in-law
God, I wouldn't mind that at all
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Daddy brought his gun out, but I'm still knocking
The sun was coming back around, but I'm still falling
Even though you do these things, girl, I know you want me
This little light of mine, watch you until I go blind

Why you cheatin'? Why you lyin'?
Girl, you must be out yo mind
Plotting, scheming on the low, lyin', thieving, you so cold
Dreaming until we grow old, I know you hear me, quit acting like you don't

Hey, hey, girl, let's go, tell me something that I'd like to know
Take me to a place that I'd like to go, we can stay here now, the weather ain't that cold
Sing to me but use your throat, do that thing I know you hate, but your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, you know I love

Is ya down to watch the sun rise? Is ya down to let me fuck ya right?
Is ya ever gonna call me back? Is ya daddy still mad at that?
I won't move my car out the drive, come and let me take you for a ride
Killed my best friend, me and my bae sitting sideways
They don't like me, I know you blocked my number, baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Daddy brought his gun out, but I'm still knocking
The sun was coming back around, but I'm still falling
Even though you do these things, girl, I know you want me
I know you blocked my number, baby, baby, baby, I'm still calling

Love the green, but the red look awesome
Love the sex, but the head was awesome
Smoke filled the room, we jammed Janis Joplin
Wanna hold until we go numb, wanna cum until it's no fun
Wanna get a gun just to own one

What if I took your heart and made a street?
What if you burned my soul instead of your weed?
Why must you do things that always make me weak?
Wipe the filth off of your palms inside your mother's sink

All the love that we kept, all the secrets, too
The closets open, still room for me and you
There's a war outside, no love inside
There's a guy in my mind with a nine that shine
I hope he blast it, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open, waiting on everything to open",rap

The heat, and make the street jog like you on a treadmill
Sometimes I'm so high I feel like I'm from outer space
I'm on a mission and I got the movement to take its place
My rhymes like maps and my style ain't no surprise
I'm coming through so don't try to stand in my way and you'll be wise 
Listen to my homies on the corner and they'll tell you
That when I get a flow it's gonna be like a Big Bang Theory 
Like an explosion, I don't think it can wait
Now when I start to grip the mic I rip it like an 8
No matter where I'm at I spit a style so unique
Take the track and make it crack like a split pea soup
My rhymes is like a gun, and you better watch out
Cause I'm gonna blow up the spot and make it shout
No limits when it come to my lyrical flight
My flow's so tight it'll make your mind go blind tonight
And when I step up to the mic and drop it low
I'll make your hip hop soul jump up and shine like a light show

Democracy is the land of the free, but we all might die if there's a World War Three

Catch me up in the clubs, throwing money and sippin' champagne on ice
I'm so far ahead of time, I'm a king of this trap
Nothing left to understand, now I'm making a stack
This money's getting bigger, no time to play games
You can tell by the way my pockets are getting swollen
Couple bricks in the attic, it's a blessing and a curse
I been ballin' on my enemies, they know I'm the worst
Money, power and respect it's all that I seek
I'm in the club, stuntin' on these bitches, and sippin' on drank
Gotta keep it real like it's written in the street
These niggas know my name, I'm air force feet
My life is a movie, no one can script me
My life is real, so don't wanna get with me
Money talks, bitches listen, and haters watch
Tried to take me down, but I'm ready for the guap",rap

No time to dwell on the past
My life could never be like a book from the stack
My granny used to say I'm no ordinary guy
No love like ours can ever be denied

Holding on, to this moment in time
The sun on my face, it's feeling so refinement
Reaching out and taking control
My heart is strong, I'm never losing my soul

Try me, try me, come and see what I'm made of
Story of my life, it's never hard to love
From the struggle comes real stories of strength
This is life, and I'm owning it every step

The flow of the music is like a river that's wild
My words keep on creating a new rhyme
Hearts that we touch will always be on the rise
We show them love and we fill it with pride

Try me, try me, and you'll never be the same
No more running, your love will remain
Stay true to this bond, it's the only thing that matters
My heart and soul won't ever be shattered

Take me high, so I can touch the sky
My love for you, an intangible thing
Stay with me as I journey through life
We'll laugh and we'll cry, and feel nothing but delight

Try me, try me, never say goodbye
My love will stay, and I'll never deny
This bond that we have, it's something so strong
We'll never fade, and forever we'll see it along",rap

Hear me now and then spread around.

Gonna break the rules and step up our game-changers.

Verse 1
Tech Money tech money, tech money tech money
The same corporate giants rollin' round like it's funny
The way they move in just to take it away
Can't even afford to rent the same day it hits the way
The tide rolls in, sit and watch the show
The culture gone, the rent sky high like a rainbow
Where we gonna go, the gentrification's out of control
How can we make it out, there's no goin' back as we know

Chorus
Tech money tech money, tech money tech money
Been seein' it since the 90's with the dot com condo
Money's made and its never enough
It's squeezing us out and it's really too tough

Verse 2 
Eviction signs seen all around the block
Tired of fighting it, no more we can take, the shock
Empty lots and corporate logos, can't stand it no more
Gettin' pushed out, I'm ready to roar
Heading to the streets and standing for my rights
Losing the culture, this dead end life
Tired of the same cycle, livin' in despair
The people, the culture, the spirit, all gone from here

Don't let em take it, we gotta make this right
We have the power, we'll have the might
Corporate culture try to follow, but they won't win
Show em we got the strength to take it back again
We'll bring the culture back with no doubt
The same way we took it away, there's no way out
We'll be dashing on hope, empowerin' the people
Gettin' it back with all we can give to the sequel

Verse 1
I'm tryna get a grip on the situation,
Livin' large in the wrong destination
Ain't got the flow, got no destination
Just trying to find a livin' situation
The rents too high and the wages too low
Start to feel like I'm livin' in a snow globe
Tech money, tech money, tech money, tech money
Saw it comin' in, when I sensed danger
Money flows, but it still feels strange
'Cause the ones with the wealth, they don't look the same
Just roll with it, accept the change

Verse 2
Got the tech money, do the tech dance
Can't afford to take a chance
Rather take the risk, like showin' my hand
Gettin' the shots, but runnin' out of plans
The stakes are high and the game is cold
The tech geeks are having their way with the world
Tech money, tech money, tech money, tech money
They reorganize, to get the most money
Discriminating the low, so that's why I moan
Feels like a hurricane, but we won't be blown
Forcefully evicted, by the techs with no soul

Verse 3
My family's homeless, I'm just tryin' to cope
Where's the culture at? It's been robbed of its hope
It's like my city is too far in and I'm out
And they don't seem to care what it's all about
But I'm not gonna quit, I put down my sword
Gonna use my stormin' voice to break down the doors
Tech money, tech money, tech money, tech money
Gonna talk about the ways they get paid
It's gonna be part of the message I'm set to be made
Fight for my rights, gettin' ready to wage
The battle of my life, I'm gonna make it my stage",rap

Lost in the darkness, nocturnal rhymes I spit
Feeling wicked, sick and twisted, need a hit
The Devil's eyes, they follow me and they never quit
I disappear, I'm taking flights of fear just a bit
The punk rock steel toes and horns and halos, I'm blessed
Nine inch nails rattle, now no one can forget
Ricochet off the walls, and then flow down the hall
Gotta get paid, Mr. Shifty Switchblade can't fall

Wrapped in the moonlight I'm ready to ride
A feeling I can't seem to define
The power it holds keeps me mesmerized
That charm and those dreams keep me hypnotized

Or fly to the heavens that watch over you, telling me it's all voodoo
Voodoo too, it's just what you do

As I start to move, I feel the night take me
An emotion so powerful I can't deny
A blissful euphoria I can never describe
A destination that I never want to arrive

Unlocking a realm of passion unbound
Power of the unknown, I lose all control
Unleashing a love like never before

Verse1:
Feel the power of the unknown,
Mysteries of the soul are shown,
Carry me to higher heights,
Exploring all the hidden sights,
And as I journey through the stars,

A vision appears in a spectral form,
Awakened by a holy storm.

My body reacts in an altered state,
A spiritual force that's inside me,
Helping me to open up and see,
Arriving in my sacred space,

All the secrets I'll soon possess.

It's the knowledge of the unseen,
That sets me free from all my sins,

The power of the voodoo too feeds my soul,
And guides me on my journey home.

'Cause when the mobb turn it up, we just blast away
When that heat come around, niggas run and hit the pavement.
Been runnin' through the hoods, makin' moves for days
Jumpin' out the car in the groove, blastin' all these ways.

Gettin' money every night, that's why these hoes roll.
Fishtailin' on the highway, I got my hands on the wheel
Pushin' that gas, tryin' to make a real-life deal.
Runnin' through the hoods, lookin' for a spot to hit
With the AK on my side, they know I'm slippin' with the grit.
Shootin up the clubs, breakin' up a fight
Gettin' all the money and leavin' without a sight.

In the game forever, ridin' through the streets, this is my claim.

Bust out my AK, y'all gotta show respect or I'm shootin'
From the hood to the club bumpin' this heat
Where I come from they don't mess around on the street

Verse 1:

Let me take it straight to the top, I ain't stoppin'
My Glock's hot with a full clip, no breakin'
My AK is puttin' in much work, poppin' the clip
A little voice in my head said, ""Let's make 'em trip""

Chorus:

Gonna hit the club and get drunk, but they better start gettin' off

All up in the drop with the riot pump, blazin'

Verse 3:

Punks want funk, but they don't shoot once, hit the gas
And then they gone, little ho tried to pick Bo like an afro

But I was blinded, by my own delusions too
Though I've done all I can, I'm failing really badly
Couldn't wake your Sleeping Beauty or help you face her sadly

Chorus:
Sleeping Beauty, so poisoned and helpless
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
My efforts were for naught, so desperately I seek
To find a way to bring you back, a cure so incredibly bleak

Verse 2:
Breaking through the haze, I thought I could break these chains
Hiding from a poison, you can't ever truly explain
Maybe I was wrong, my efforts barely show
My futile attempts, only making your pain grow

Chorus:
Sleeping Beauty, so poisoned and helpless
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
My efforts were for naught, so desperately I seek
To find a way to bring you back, a cure so incredibly bleak

Verse 3:
My ego was so high, thought I could make it right
If I kissed you one more time, to bring you light
But you were too far gone, for me to heal
My deluded mind, I had to soon reveal

Verse 1 
I've looked and seen what's ahead of me, 
My heart is broken, I can't take no more, 
These lonely nights, my faith is low, 
Where can I find the hope I once knew? 
I watched the seasons come and go, 
My face still holds a feel of woe, 
First step I take, I'm sure of this, 
I'm in trouble, this much I miss.

Chorus 
Tell me how can I live without somebody like you? 
Somebody like you, tell me how can I live without somebody like you?
Please tell me it's almost over.

Verse 2 
I'm here feeling lost and alone,
The room is filled with reminders of you,
Memories rushing through my mind,
My heart can't take this pain of mine.

Chorus 
Tell me how can I live without somebody like you? 
Somebody like you, tell me how can I live without somebody like you?
Please tell me it's almost over.

How can I live without you? 
As I watch the stars at night, 
How can I live without you? 
My heart still beats, but I'm still alone tonight.

Somebody like you, tell me how can I live without somebody like you?

And sit around like a parrot, all brainwashed and told

My mission is clear, just tryna break the chains
The lies and all the pains, I'm tryna make a change
The pollution of the world, my mind made a choice

I know this young nigga who loves to keep his gun in his pockets
Gotta get this cash quick, tryin to dodge all these block rocks  
He lost his Moms at a young age, Pops was crackin'
Family house was full of drugs, they slept with their macs out
Where we stay, no basketball teams, no neighbors, it's all 'bout makin' the cream
So he stayed dirty, copped a clip for thirty, chose sellin' drugs than bein' nerdy
Had his hardhat but still ready for war, got his heart gone, I saw this before
He lived day by day, prey by prey, stayed blunted on Chancellor Ave
380 hallway, bought an AK, I know he gonna spray
It ain't no damn way that he can turn his life around, man  
Gotta stay eatin', so he got the clip out, all smoked up, put his finger on the trigger, death flew out
Hit a man, layin' on the pavement, all stiff, blood dripping from his face, damn
Now what a surprise that Little Ant can't come around
It's his own man dead on the ground, dead on the ground  
Lost, turned out, no doubt, what's it all 'bout?
Lost, turned out, no doubt, what's it all 'bout?  
Baby girl, I can see you in that crazy world, spinnin' out of control, nowhere to go
At one point in time, you could've been mine, but movin' too fast, couldn't take the chance 
High school homies, now they became friends before lovers, kinda like sister and brother
My momma workin' all the time, your daddy snoopin', drinkin' and creepin'
What he thinking, tryin' to bump and grind?
We escaped to each other, I had my dreams, my plane leavin' soon, but had to hook up with Pac 
Called twice, but you weren't home, somethin' was wrong, I was right  
Found you one night, barely holdin' on, where did you go wrong?
Was it when you started strippin' for tips, then sellin' it for more chips?
Sniffin' powder, just to deal with it, now you gone, before it can be fixed
My brother, Sean, he's home now, I love him to death, but stayin' in all the bullshit  
Gettin' older, middle school around the corner, drug dealers teachin' what they wanna
I made my first sale in a alleyway, I was scared as shit, but not of the cops
More scared of what Moms Duke'll do, chilled for a few, rather than spend weekends with the homies
Food was low, but Moms made it good, and I was countin' every single cent they made
Moms got hurt, slipped on the ice, caught a back spasm, tried to deal with the pain
Lost and turned out, but still comin' home to you, I love you, I love you
Lost and turned out, but still comin' home to you, I love you

I can see this young nigga with a gun in his jeans
Workin hard in the streets for a little green
He was tryin to make a lot of money fast

But there's no way for him to turn his life around
Cuz livin on the streets he'll eventually be found
He try to put a lid on his fears and his doubts
But it's hard to escape when you livin with no out 
Damn, He's lost and turned out, not a doubt what's it all about
Livin a life filled with pain and with doubt
But he's still comin home to his loved ones at night
Tryna keep it together and make it alright
So he hustles all day just to be able to survive
But he's hopin one day he escape this way of life
Makin sure that he can take care of his family
Stayin by their side no matter what's to be
Lost and turned out still comin home to you, I love you
Lost and turned out still comin home to you, I love you
He's lost and turned out not a doubt what's it all about
Lost and turned out not a doubt what's it all about
In a world where he's lost and his future is seen as out of bounds 
He still doin his best to make the right sound
Tryna keep it positive and stay on the right track 
But his way of life will always come with a lack
No matter how hard he try to free himself
Old habits die hard and he's livin by himself
He's tryin to make a real life not just one of vice
So he keep tryin and hold on to the advice

Man, I thought I was dreaming
Manipulating me like I'm nothing but a puppet on a string

Verse 1:
It's like a constant struggle to break free from you,
I'm trying to find a way to start anew.
But it's not easy, you know, with the weight of what you say,
I'm stuck in a place where nothing never changes.
You try to control me with your words,
But that only molds me into a bird,
That's trying to break free from its cage,
Cause I'm tired of living in a wrong age.

I'm trying to remain strong but it's not easy,
So many questions, so little answers I seek.
I'm trying hard, to get away from the lies,
But all I'm feeling, is more pain in disguise.
It's like I'm being dragged down in a whirlpool,
The only thing that I can do is keep it cool.
And try to keep my head above the water,
Just to stay alive, so I can still keep my honor.

VERSE 1
I woke up with thoughts of ambition
Rapping hard and grinding on the rhythm
No matter where I go I'm heard with precision
Pushing through the limits of my mission
Money's my obsession but I don't play those games

Haters gonna hate, but when I win, it's still the same
I'm destined for greatness, so I won't take their aim

CHORUS
Cause I'm a risk, but if you put it on I'mma win
If you give it time, I won't forget when I'm a legend baby and we're all rich

I got you, I promise, I promise I'm on it

VERSE 2
My sight is set to greater heights, no holding me back
Dreams of a better life, I'm ready for this track
They tried to break me down, but I went the other way
Hustling hard and grinding until I get paid

Ain't no stopping me, no matter what comes
Through the pain and the struggle I remain strong
Ready to take these steps and nothing's gonna go wrong

Gotta take on all my fears and keep pushin' on

Verse 2:
Got a plan and a vision, I'm pushin' every day

Stayin' on the grind, see the light through the dyin'
Gonna take it all the way, gonna make it to the top
Gonna take it all on, so it never ever stops

Verse One:
I'm just sittin' here watchin' you, livin' like a fool
It's like this man don't have a clue, don't have a thing to do
You don't realize what you got, you should be feelin' blessed
But instead I'm sittin' here seein' you in a total mess
He don't appreciate you, it's plain to see
It's breaking my heart, but I'm gonna let it be

Verse Two:
I can't stand to see you so low, like you don't have no soul
You got the beauty and the grace, a heart of gold
You deserve to have the world, cause you deserve the best
But your man don't understand, and he don't give you no rest
He ain't gonna take you for granted, no more that's for sure
I just gotta stand back and trust, cuz I know the time will cure

Verse Three:
So why don't you take a stand, show the world what you got
Ain't gonna be no man, that can make you feel like you're not
You got the power and the strength, to reach heights you never dreamed
It's gonna take some time, but I know it won't be as it seems
You're gonna get it together, you know what you gotta do
And then you'll see there's no man, that can ever compare to you

Chorus:

He ain't the one, he don't deserve

So many times you shed those tears

If he don't appreciate how you feel
My love for you will never fail

Bein' real with yourself and me
Cause you know that's the only way to be

I've been so faithful to God, though I tried to turn away
But I'm still struggling just to keep up, and I can't seem to find the way 
Even when I'm on top, I still feel like I'm below
There's never enough money to make up for the love I don't know
I used to be so proud, and people said I'm the man 
I thought I could take on the world, but it all just fell apart like sand
I've been so ungrateful, God I'm sorry for the times I said goodbye
I'll never be able to take away the hurt I caused to you, so I try
I'm hoping that someday, the truth will set me free 
I'm hoping that the truth will show me the real me

Verse 1
Lookin' out across the street, see the chosen one
Tryin' to make her way, pushin' through the dust and sun
Ain't had no second chance, no one to pick her up
She lookin' for her strength, they told her it's enough

Beautiful is how we know you though
Rebel rebel for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle reach out
And rip the back of your head off, leavin' your skull peaceful

So misunderstood, a burden on her brow
So misunderstood, but she still holdin' on somehow
Her broken wings still can carry her along
She never let the past define who she become

Beautiful is how we know you, though rebel rebel for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle reach out and rip the back of your head off

Verse 2:
Where mommas and poppas didn't teach what's right
You do what's yours, ain't no one there to protect you in the night
But you still got up and gave life a try
Fighting against all odds, no grave will be your home, no lie

Beautiful is how we know you, though we were all taught to root for the underdogs
One nation under God complex, no wonder we all wanna watch 'em undercover cops
Beautiful is how we know you though

Verse 3:
They said you have no chance of ever making it
But you still rise up, never letting it break you bit by bit
You chose to fight, knowing it would be tough
Courage within so strong, you'll never give in to their bluff

Beautiful is how we know you, though so beautiful so upset
Came from a place that bred success, so shame on the grass on that side of the fence
Beautiful is how we know you though

Misunderstood but you keep going strong
You built yourself up piece by piece and worked your way to the top where you belong
Painful memories, but still you keep it real
No matter what comes, you know you can truly make a deal

To lead the change and get these people up on their feet

My lyrics will raise your vibrations to places unseen
To open your mind and let the world know what it means

I bring an original style, a form of creativity that no one can deny
From the concrete jungles to indigenous lands
My words can be heard by the masses and I'm ready to stand

"ing that s what i m about green cup full of lean thunder in the sky i m hearing the sounds pouring up brown and yellow my swag dripping while i m on the low h dollars in the banks and my feet steady spitting out the flow got my eyes on the door my cup full of syrup and more hooked up with the team and the syrup at the store 

Racks in my pocket, got some cash to blow
My top down in my hood, thats the way to go
Pouring up some lean, got my eyes all red
Gotta get my fix, can't go to bed
I'm so high, it's like I'm in the sky
Everything I see, so damn fly
So much fire, it can't be denied
Sippin on my cup, 'til I'm satisfied
I mix that Qualitest with the clean
Dreaming of a lake, filled full of lean
Rainbow colors in my cup, what a sight to see
Jolly Ranchers mane, this shits good as f***
Got residue on my shirt, my cup's gettin' dirty
Moving slow, on the e-way, doing 'bout thirty
Been drinking and driving, won't have it no more
Gettin' throwed, swervin' all over the floor
Brick Squad, the ones I'm talkin' 'bout
Green cup filled with lean, thunder in the cloud
It's pouring up brown and yellow, my swag is drippin'
Yellow dolla's in the banks and my feet keep spittin'
Got my eyes on the door, my cup full of syrup and more
Hooked up with the team, the syrup at the store
I'm so high, I can't even hit the floor
Movin' like a king, my cup full of syrup and fo'",rap
" i walk in the club got the double cup 

Hold up, I'ma get me a double cup
Reach for the syrup, cause I'm makin' it tough
Roll it up, I'ma smoke it up, ain't no stoppin' me now
Mix it with the tea and take me to the stars
Riding round free, sippin' this lean
Hear me run up on the scene, rubber bands and some cream
I'm sippin' that purple-yellow, getting low like a bell
Feeling like I'm in the clouds, I just want to feel the breeze
Swear I'm feeling like a king, can't nobody tell me nothing
Pass me the lean and roll me a sweet
Can't nobody take away my heat
Got me feeling like the streets runnin' through my veins
Takin' me higher than the satellite
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
Got me poppin' bottles in VIP, head foggy like the sea
Rappers talkin' money, but never really got it
Switchin' up the cup, can't keep it static
Ain't no stoppin' me, cause I'm ridin' with the top
Smokin' and leanin', I'm feeling like a rockstar
I'm too high to be stopped, it's a vibe I can't drop
My double cup is heavy, with syrup and weak
My nigga, pour me some more, cause I'm feeling like I'm free
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
Feel this heat I breath, hot like the summer
I'm here to stay, no need to run and hide
Livin' my life on the block and I ain't tryina switch it
Can't get enough of this syrup so I keep sippin' it
This my story, my life, this is my mission
Drinkin' on syrup, cause that's the only thing keepin' me alive
Throwing up sign and I'm living for the night
This my life, tippin' my cup, only thing I'm doin' is gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed
That's that syrup, motherfucker, that's that syrup, I'm gettin' throwed",rap

Commitment to the music, no time for fairy tales

Cuz with my flow they can't stop me, not even clowns

Don't need the rules, I'll take my own load

Verse 1
I'm a G in this flow, hit the mic and let it go
Tell the truth, staying true to the game, don't need no show
Cause it's all business, I'm a hustler, I'mma stay grittin'
You can't knock it, man, tell 'em how I'm livin'
My pen's on fire, can't put out this flame
Gotta stay consistent, shout out my name
Be the Don I'm destined, and I'm all about the dough
Can't help if the money keeps comin' in, I'm just ready to flow

Verse 2
I'm the one, so yeah it's time to take a leap
Gotta keep moving, keep banging out the beats
Money's my motivation and it's time to stay paid
Ain't too much time for chit chat or debate
Ok, let me run it back, yeah, I'm bringing it back
Been a long time, gonna take a lot of rap
Growing up, seen a lot of things, yeah, I know the facts
Gone now but never forget, can't go back

Verse 3
My engine's on, I'ma keep it rolling through the city
Ain't nothing but a party, so get ready for the pity
My flow is like a weapon, might need a permit
Tell the truth and keep it real, no need to fake it

Staying focused, still the same, can't change
This is what I'm born for, just another day in the game",rap

Verse 1 
Hear my words, they bring the light,
Bringin' faith to hopeless flight,
Gettin' tired of the same ol' plight,
It's the same old stories, the same ol' fight.

I'm from the hood and the struggle's real,
Gotta stay focused if you want to appeal,
Nobody's gonna hand you a deal,
You gotta figure it out with no retreat.

Chorus
It's up and downs for a real nigga,
You'll be lame all your life hater,
But don't pull the trigger,
You got something to contribute, regardless what you into.

Verse 2 
The odds against us, but we can't give in,
The people around us don't show no wins,
Remember that it's full of sin,
And one wrong step can spin us around again.

Gotta stay strong and keep the faith,
Don't let the game determine our fate,
Stay away from the mac 10 in the black Benz,
Those signals of betrayal will make you descend.

Chorus
It's up and downs for a real nigga,
You'll be lame all your life hater,
But don't pull the trigger,
You got something to contribute, regardless what you into.

Verse 3
From the triple bunks to the street talks,
Life's a maze, sometimes you gotta walk,
Bet my life I'm a dice shaker,
Electric lights on a skyscraper.

We've all been raised wrong but we stayed strong,
We gotta get the most from life before the song's done,
Gotta make sure we're helping each other out,
Victory will come when we shout.

Chorus
It's up and downs for a real nigga,
You'll be lame all your life hater,
But don't pull the trigger,
You got something to contribute, regardless what you into.",rap
" and above 

Yeah uh yeah this your life you can play with it 
Do your thing just be safe with it 
I'm still up in this game, nothing to lose and no gain 
My attitude's got me livin' with no shame 
I'm tired of hustling, tired of grindin' 
Cause all I got is my hustle and my pride
I need to keep it moving, can't fall behind
Gotta keep my focus and my faith alive

My only weapon is the wisdom I find 
In the street I'm searching for something I can own
If I'm fallin' down, I'm on the rise
I'm stayin' strong, I'm livin' for the prize

The vision I have I keep alive
Ain't nobody stoppin' me to take the drive
The odds might be against me but I'ma thrive
My life's what I make of it, I'ma survive 

I'm steppin' out, gonna get it right
I'ma breach the darkness, I'ma be the light
I'm learnin' somethin' new every night
Strengthenin' my spirit and standing up to the fight

My goals and my dreams, I'm gonna reach 'em high
I'm followin' the path of destiny I'm tryin' 
To stay alive and keep it real 
And never let no one stop me from achieving my goals",rap

Chorus:
I got the devil in me and it's a cloud,
I try to find a way to stay on top of the cloud.
Fuel and release, happiness is good for an hour,
These thoughts I have they seem to pass me by like a cloud.

Verse 1:
When I look to find compassion, it vanishes like a ghost,
I need some laughter, so I can feel less like a ghost.
I was praying for some relief, but it just seemed so distant,
I hate what he did to her, I can’t stand for his persistence.

Chorus:

Verse 2:
My burdens are heavy, and I’m barely staying afloat,
The darkness seems to follow, I can’t even keep afloat.
I find myself drowning more and more every single day,
I know there has to be a way out of this wretched place.

Chorus:

Verse 3:
I must find the courage to overcome this internal ghost,
I can't keep living in sadness, I can't keep living like a ghost.
I've gotta find a way to rise above the dark and sahaed sky,
So I can escape this storm, these dark thoughts won't take me by.

My heart can't stop beating so fast, prayers for joy but no one cares
The sadness that brings me to tears, in this world of fear I'm caught
And day after day, I just go on, no release from this mental war I fought

And I'm gonna make it, I'm never gonna break it
In the back of my mind I know I can take it
So when I come around its like yeah yeah yeah
They got a bad chick named Roxanne
She don't pop xan no mo, she don't pop xan no mo
Feelin' like a million bucks so I'm gonna break it down
Don't worry 'bout what these haters say just keep living life to the sound
Lost in the music and the lights, yeah that's where I'm at
Get lost in the beat and I'm never ever comin' back
Ayy, I'ma show em somethin' new so they can't ignore me
Gonna make em get to krunk when they come up in the party
Yeah yeah yeah, they got a bad chick named Roxanne
She don't pop xan no mo, she don't pop xan no mo
I'm gonna be the one they can't forget
I'm gonna go round the world and show em it was worth it
Yeah, I'm gonna keep on grindin' and I'm never gonna quit
Gonna take what I deserve 'til I'm sittin' at the top of the list
Yeah yeah yeah, they got a bad chick named Roxanne

Verse 1
I'm livin life around the clock
Tryin to make sense of what I see, life's a puzzle I can't unlock
My heart is heavy, searching for a remedy
But all I see is lies and false reality
In the hood it's criminal activity
My momma said, ""Always do right and stay away from the streets""
But I'm surrounded by folks livin' life on the beat
Now I'm running out of hope, they just don't understand
I'm tryin' to make it but I don't have a plan
The pressure's building, the stress I can't hide
I'm tryin' to live and not get caught on the ride

Chorus
The world is a crazy place, a smiling face may or may not be friendly
Good things have side effects, bad things have benefits
I wanna live till the end, try to survive all the messed up tunes and verses
Curses and drivebys, unheard of opinions, and bad beef and greasy fries
Teachers who are unwise, preachers between young thighs
Guns, knives and power in the wrong hands, landlords and crooked cops, oh Lord
Look at the shit we stand for, plan for a perfect life and ended up gettin jerked

Verse 2
I bid a farewell to the life I thought I knew
I'm running away to a place where I can find my true self
Away from materialistic things, and social status
Away from the fools who only want us to fail
Away from the darkness, to a light that will lead me
To a world where I can fight for a better tomorrow
My dreams give me hope, as I try to stay focused
I'm gonna keep on grinding, until I find a way out
I'm gonna break free from the chains and the misery
The world is not gonna hold me back from what I can be

Chorus
The world is a crazy place, a smiling face may or may not be friendly
Good things have side effects, bad things have benefits
I wanna live till the end, try to survive all the messed up tunes and verses
Curses and drivebys, unheard of opinions, and bad beef and greasy fries
Teachers who are unwise, preachers between young thighs
Guns, knives and power in the wrong hands, landlords and crooked cops, oh Lord
Look at the shit we stand for, plan for a perfect life and ended up gettin jerked",rap
"

I atak like PM on the meanest tracks,
I make the people move, I show them where I'm at.
Came from the hood tryna get a perfect life,
End up getting jipped, don't understand the strife.

Chorus
This universe universe fucked up tunes and verses,
Curses and drivebys, unheard opinions and bad beef.
Greasy fries and teachers who are unwise,
Preachers between young thighs and guns, knives and power in the wrong hands.

Paying my dues and a little bit of extra,
Only fresh effects I saw came from Corey Shaw.
Can't get too wild and too raw, can't help but be scared and unprepared
Know in life you motherfuckers just don't care.

So I struggle on and try to get my bubble on,
Stumble upon a little light, I'm trying to magnify.
Be damned if I don't fit into the plan,
Been around the block, life has me in a trance.

Good things have side effects, bad things have benefits,
Try and live until the end and watch Armageddon's set.
TV's got some hella good shows and the internet,
That shit's off the hook and illuminates the effects.

I drop a book in a second, being stuck with technology advancement,
The world is a crazy place and a smiling face may or may not be friendly.
One way or another, life is unpredictable,
My little brother's rich and Wolfhawk Tommy's a father.

Chorus
This universe universe fucked up tunes and verses,
Curses and drivebys, unheard opinions and bad beef.

Verse 1: 
As luck would have it, My best friend, the brown skin nigga with the braids, not the pussy nigga with the fade
Had to focus on our career, others tryna be club owners
Got the ears of a major label now, everybody in the world on it
Heart of a Tiger will commit homicide, dismantle any challengers or rivals
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive, NTM-A to police, you'll never take me alive

Chorus:
I'm a Tiger, I'm a Tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
Until you make the peace, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger

Verse 2: 
Altercations, I'm thinking Travis must really hate me
Been like a brother since middle school, woulda never rapped until he made me
Used to flip hoes together, go out together, do shows together still amazes me
Kinda crazy how popularity can make you change
Got his nova, I was happy for him
Got his Burban, I was happy for him
Got his Benz, I was happy for him
Got his Hummer, I was happy for him
No nigga round I wouldn'ta splattered for him, put their head on a platter for him
Never disrespected your bitch boy I protected your bitch boy
When niggas that we both know was tryna put dick on your bitch boy
All you ever did was criticize me, pillow talk to the world bout me
These tears drops on my face real, My mom will tell you I'm not stuntin
Juvenile detention for self defense, broad day I popped somethin

Chorus:
I'm a Tiger, I'm a Tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
Until you make the peace, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger

Verse 3:
Her ex boyfriend broke her ribs, blacked her eyes I shot somethin 
Scuse me, I'm my own man in jail or on land always tryna fight me
How the fuck you hurt a nigga you love, I would never put my hands on you
Reason being you a nigga I love, Heart of a Tiger will commit homicide
Dismantle any challengers or rivals, Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
NTM-A to police, you'll never take me alive, I'm a Tiger

Outro:
I'm a Tiger, I'm a Tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive

The sound of the street is calling my name
My soul is aching, my heart is full of pain
Stuck in a cycle of poverty and strife
I'm down but I'm not out, I'm ready for a new life

The pain I embrace, it won't keep me down
Cuz I'm a black man and I won't back down
I won't be afraid, I'll keep on pushing on
To find a new way even when the odds are long

Chorus:
I'm livin trife, I'm livin life on the darkside
Fed up, I'm done with stressin, I'm breakin the ties
Givin up the pain and losin my pride
Move forward, I'm gonna reach the other side

See myself through different eyes
Release the hate and anger inside
As I search for redemption, I won't forget
My brothers and my sisters, they'll never forget

A new way of thinkin, the devil can't take
A truer perspective, it's never too late
Look out for those around, I'll be their guide
Cos I can't give up, I'm never denied

Chorus:
I'm livin trife, I'm livin life on the darkside
Fed up, I'm done with stressin, I'm breakin the ties
Givin up the pain and losin my pride
Move forward, I'm gonna reach the other side

Livin on the darkside, life ain't easy
My soul is searchin, I'm lookin for an escape
I'm never gonna give up, I'm gonna stand tall
My head heldhigh and my future is on the wall

No more pain or sorrow, this I can see
A new life awaits me, a brighter destiny
I'm livin trife, I'm livin life on the darkside
And nothing can stop me, I'm reachin the other side

Chorus:

They can't take away my vision, I done made it clear,
An OG in the game, playin' with no fear,
My hustle's on blast and I'm never losin' steam,
Livin' life a king, I'm the one they call to be,
How it feel to be a real nigga,
How it feel to be a real nigga,
How it feel to be a real nigga,
How it feel to be a real nigga.",rap

Verse 1:
Y'all can talk but I'ma keep dropping these bars
Know these beats I'm spitting hit harder than cars
Rolling with my squad, we ain't no throwers
Run up on us and we'll leave you in zero
Set this track off with a crack like a gun
Going out of bounds, but I'm still getting it done
Flow smooth like honey, I ain't from the hood
Gonna go hard and y'all know you ain't gon' stop me for good

Chorus:
I just want to jam for you
Rhymes that hit hard like rumble in a zoo
I'm gonna keep it going long

Dipping and dodging, they know G ain't no joke
I just want to jam for you

Verse 2:
Keeping it real, I don't play like a clown
Beating these tracks, I'ma put it down
Gonna break it down like lego blocks
Duplicating style, but my flows unique like knock

Until you feel this power and you know it's sound
Rock it on the mic and make your heart pound
Gonna show the world what I got, ain't no holding back now

I just want to jam for you
Rhymes that hit hard like rumble in a zoo

Dipping and dodging, they know G ain't no joke
I just want to jam for you

Verse 3:
My beats go hard and I'ma keep it up
You already know G is gonna light it up
Getting down like a double-dutch rope
I'ma keep 'em coming, no way to cope
And I'ma keep it hype, with flows that's real tight
Yeah, these beats are nice, but these rhymes are out of sight
You can tell G is never gonna lose the fight
From the start to the finish, gonna bring the light

Chorus:
I just want to jam for you
Rhymes that hit hard like rumble in a zoo
I'm gonna keep it going long
Knocking these tracks out like 'em for sure
I just want to jam for you
Making sure I keep it true

Dipping and dodging, they know G ain't no joke

Verse 1:
Gripping to memories of you, my past is all I have
Your silhouette in the wind I see, a part of me that I can’t let go
It’s okay to get scared and feel the pain, there’s no need to be ashamed
Just rise up and make the change, let me be the one to take the blame

Chorus:
I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling likely dreaming of the pain
I hope you’ll hear me in the streetlights, humming softly breathing out your name
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling scars will remain
So let’s scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain

Verse 2:
The dark skies won’t let us reach the sun, but I can still feel the warmth of your touch
Your love keeps my heart alive and I hope it never does enough
Cause I still see us underway, even though you’re miles away
A bond that’ll never break, no matter how far we sway

Chorus:
I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling likely dreaming of the pain
I hope you’ll hear me in the streetlights, humming softly breathing out your name
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling scars will remain
So let’s scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain

Bridge:
And when they run into the river oh no let the water not complain
I swear that even with the distance slowly wearing out your name
Your hands still catch the light the right way, and our hearts still beat the same

Chorus:
I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling likely dreaming of the pain

Likely dreaming off the pain
I hope you'll hear me in the streetlights humming,

Verse 2:
We made our choices, we had our voices,
Both too loud or too quiet.
But in the silence, I hear the violence,
The sound of our love being torn apart.

I know that even with the seams stitched tightly darling,
Scars will remain.
I say we scrape them from each other darling
And let them wash off in the rain.

And the thunder sing us by,
Reminding us just what we need,
Just what we need.

My rap bars of fire, my words like an iron spear
Contender beware when I drop the verbal atmosphere

Bring it hard and fast like a thunder in the night

Slangin' bars like an addict and never missin'
Tired of fake MCs that think they got game
Cause they ain't got nothing to show foor their name

Verse 1
All these years I have been nothing but lonely,
Seems like I’ve been here for far too long,
My fears and my feeling are deeply entrenched,
Stuck in this cycle of being forever gone.

Chorus
Say you want to leave and say we'd never have the way,
We always hope and we'd cry and say hello to alone again,
Coz everything's broken, everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again,
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded, everything's wasted time again.

Verse 2
Struggles and heartache have only gotten worse,
My life a never-ending spiral of pain,
Unable to touch the joys I never had,
Caught in a state of permanent disdain.

Chorus
Say you want to leave and say we'd never have the way,

Never could find the peace I was so longing for,
And so we leave this stage with all our best written lines,
Heads held high as we march toward the door.

Chorus
Say you want to leave and say we'd never have the way,
We always hope and we'd cry and say hello to alone again,
Coz everything's broken, everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again,
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded, everything's wasted time again.",rap
" and move on with our lives

Verse 1:
Ain't no escaping all these feelings, it's so hard to keep believing
That we'll ever find a way back to our happy ending
These empty words between us can't cut the aching
So say it to my face, look me in the eye and just keep speaking

Chorus:
Say goodbye to alone again, 'cause everything's broken
Everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded
Everything's wasted time again

Verse 2:
We gotta keep our heads up, we gotta stay strong
Struggle for our freedom, even when it feels so wrong
The pressure tryna put us in a hopeless frame of mind
So we gotta rise up and we gotta be more kind

Chorus:
Say goodbye to alone again, 'cause everything's broken
Everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded
Everything's wasted time again

Verse 3:
No matter how far we go, these wounds will still remain
And all our sorrows will become the price to pay
But we must never forget what brought us to this day
So we'll just keep on pushing 'til we've finally found our way

Chorus:
Say goodbye to alone again, 'cause everything's broken
Everything's vacant, everything's wasted time again
Sentiments hopeless, innocence jaded
Everything's wasted time again",rap

Verse 1:
Relationships can be tricky when you think you're in love
Everything's great, until you think that it's enough
The dude gets too familiar, and not in a good way
Time to put him in check and get him straight today

Chorus:
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
To me, To me, To me, oh (x4)

Verse 2:
No need for all the nonsense, keep it real and stay true
Don't try to tell me what I can, and what I can't do
Respect is key in any situation, fool
Be wise, don't be a head ass, and don't be a fool

Chorus:
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
To me, To me, To me, oh (x4)

Verse 3:
No need to complicate, got to keep our heads high
Play the game right, don't mess up and make a mistake
It's all about attitude, you know what I'm sayin'
If you play it right, you won't need to be playin'

Chorus:
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
Don't be a head ass, don't be a head ass nigga
To me, To me, To me, oh (x4)",rap

Verse 1:
That's what I heard, relationships can be so strange,
Seems like it's always a game of roulette and chance,
It's so hard with these feelings, cuz everything feels new,
So when emotions start to fade, you don't know what to do,

Chorus:
Don't be a headass, don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass,
Don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass, to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me.

Verse 2:
The temptation of being on your own can be so strong,
The idea of freedom can make you think you're right for so long,
But when things start to get real, and you don't wanna face,
That's when the doubt starts to come, and the truth is hard to chase.

Chorus:
Don't be a headass, don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass,
Don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass, to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me.

Verse 3:
No matter what your situation may be,
It's important to never forget how to stay true to you and me,
So before things start to get too deep,
Remember to never forget and stay true to yourself, me and the street.

Chorus:
Don't be a headass, don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass,
Don't be a headass, nigga don't be a headass, to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me.",rap

We’ve come here from the ethers deep
Our journey never ended, it just gets further and deeper

But no force could make us stop or keep us grounded

This may be the last thing that I see so I take a look around,
I take a mental pic of the ground never forget what I found,
I can feel the clock running down, I heard that the more you wait,
The more you waste your life away and it's starting to become our fate,
My heart's aching and a little late, I know that something gotta give,
But I'm stuck between the right and wrong, I can't choose which one I live,
And when I think of the future I'm in a state of disbelief,
Only way to make it right is to take a leap of faith and believe.

So I breathe it in, I'm breathing it in,
Letting go of the pain and all that I been through,
Letting go of the past and the things I shouldn't do,
Holding on to the present, making sure the future is new,
And I'm ready to fight for a brighter tomorrow,
Been running away for so long and it's time to just stay and be strong,
There's too much happening, I can't stay calm,
Gonna stand my ground and make sure all of my goals are met way beyond.

This may be the last time I get to shine,
I'm gonna use every minute to make sure I'm align,
It's time to make changes in life and to take control,
And do my part in this world, put one foot in front of the other to reach my goals,
I heard that life ain't easy but I'm gonna stay true,
To the things that I believe, no matter what others tell me to do,
This may be the last chance I have to make things right,
Gonna keep pushing forward and make sure I get to the light.

See I'm getting lost, lost in the moment,
Gonna dance away the pain and cry whenever I want,
Find a way to express what I feel and I'm gonna keep going,
Until I reach the highest peak, even when my soul's low and my heart was broken,
Happy to be alive and doin' me,
Gonna keep moving forward and show my strength,
All those years of struggling wasn't in vain,
Gonna pick up the pieces to find my way again.

So I breathe it in, I'm breathing it in,
Letting go of the pain and all that I been through,
Letting go of the past and the things I shouldn't do,
Holding on to the present, making sure the future is new,
And I'm ready to fight for a brighter tomorrow,
Been running away for so long and it's time to just stay and be strong,
There's too much happening, I can't stay calm,
Gonna stand my ground and make sure all of my goals are met way beyond.",rap

Just give me a windbreaker, an I'm off in the night
Rap burglar murdered the first herb, who's claiming they never heard the rhyme
Giant defiant, I do it my way
Hydro-planning on tha highway, leanin' sideways, crime pays
These rhymes slay, leave 'em in the dust like the angel of music
In George we trust, rhyme pattern ridiculous
Tha conspicuous, locced out, smoked out
They rushin' the stage, tryna get choked out

Hook
Hotter than Death Valley in the summer
Ya bitch make a wish, blow it out, I'm tha re-up in a drought
Mix the stout with a lager, powered up like a lozenge
See me on tha news when I silence your favorite blogger, blam!

Verse 2
One shot, knock knock 'im out tha box
An' I'm off to th' land at the strand
Study tha flow of free speech like Francis Bacon
You're tuned in to genuine history in the makin'
When will tha P stop? Nobody knows
I construct prose with tha tenet that my tenure bestows
Close captions, you see what I'm rappin' right on tha screen
Like a limousine commercial, my rap city between tha blue an' red
It's life in my routine city, but being dead is just tha next step
An' so life's great, several prenatal success is not final
Failure is fatal, so I wake up everyday with tha pen an' play
Like potato, an' comin' straight out tha underground
I parlavor with all my fans and find a common ground that's real

Hook
We press it on vinyl, it can't be killed
If you throw it away, eternity rockin' tha land
Feel it 'til I'm refound or reground
You never know, we're infinitely larger than a DatPiff download
Just 1, 0, 1, 0, binary
Fairies are very different from the heroes from rap's yesteryear
The present, but I'm still here
He's still here, we still drink beer and take it to tha stage
At least half of tha year

Outro
So when you double an' thes on southwest
Gettin' drunk with no baggage in tha overhead
Just throw up tha funk 'cause it's not dead
In fact, it's very alive now, tha OGs with OG Kush
Blow out your SoundCloud on tha strand, watchin' it all go by
With my hand on tha wheel and a crazy dream of bein' king of a rap empire",rap
" so even though i m not where wanna be thank you lord cause i m not where my haters want me to be

I'm tryin' to reach the top so I'll never be denied,
Tryin' to succeed and reach my goals despite all the haters lies,
Know they wanna see me down, but I'ma reach my destiny,
Grateful for the blessing that come down so naturally,
I used to rock the free show, but now they pay me when I flow,
So when they try to play me, haters better run and go,
Ain't out here just flexin', I grind every single day,
Throwin' shots that break the odds, but they still remain to say,

Chorus
That even though I'm not where I wanna be,
Thank you Lord cause I'm not where my haters want me to be,
Troubles on my way, but I'mma never give up on me,
Gonna stay strong and stay focused cause I want the victory,

Verse 2
They said I wouldn't make it, but look at me now,
I'ma be the example of how far you can take it when you believe,
Paying homage to the greats that came before,
Spreading love and motivation for the next man to explore,
My will is strong and I'm so motivated,
Ain't caring what the haters say, don't wanna hear no debates,
Living in the moment, focused on my future plans,
Givin more than what I receive, keep the faith in my hands,

Chorus
That even though I'm not where I wanna be,

Troubles on my way, but I'mma never give up on me,

" i can t feel a thing just like you promised i was always bad at being good

Verse 1
I'm not broken, I'm a diamond
Let's all go home and write our rhymes
Where's my head? I'm not sure
Nobody loves the things that we endure

Chorus
Everyone is going crazy, no control
Its not my fault that they'll be sorry when I roll
Scared to life, a painless death
Make sure they know I love them right before I take my last breath

Verse 2
I can't hear your screaming it's too loud
All of my ideas become perfect little clouds
Fold me in, tucked away
I'm thinking I'll never learn what I need to know today

Chorus
All things pass, we bruise the skin
Holding onto things that we should never let within
Make them proud, dredged in guilt
Call me when the miracle becomes just coincidental

Verse 3
My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised
I was always bad at being good
There's no hell more harsh than memories, no home more vacant than an empty nest

Chorus
Winter takes the warm away
Spring takes the cold away 
Summer takes the rain away 
Fall took the one I loved away

Bridge
I believe never a place better than right here where we are
Imagining an afterlife can help us mend a broken heart
And when someone's gone, it can be a way of coping with the loss
But I don't need you out there in the cosmos, if I have you in my thoughts

Verse 4
I don't envy those in a situation that they're forced to choose
Pull the plug or not, I can't tell if it's for me or you
I know you're getting weary, tired and confused 
Sometimes letting the tired go to sleep is the best thing to do

Chorus
I will hold your head while the doctor sticks the needle in
I'll always remember our companionship and all that it has been 
And on that Sunday, October the 5th, you took your last breath
You will be missed, I'll take that to my death

My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised 
I was always bad at being good, I was always bad at being good
I was always bad, but I'll make it through, like I always said I would",rap

Verse 1
My feet stuck in the mud, I'm just trying to show love
As I'm searching for answers to the question ""What's above?""
My heart heavy with pain, the tears I cannot control
I'm looking for a sign, just to help restore my soul

Verse 2
Nobody ever said this was easy, just that it was hard
I'm standing here holding a broken heart amidst the debris that's charred
I'm stuck in this void, feeling lost and incomplete
Swallowed up by a deep sadness, I can't seem to get free

Chorus
My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised
I was always bad at being good
There's no hell more harsh than a memory

Verse 3
I'm not sure what tomorrow holds and the darkness is quite scary
I'm trying to think of a way out, something that will make this pain not so heavy
But it's hard to see a future ahead when the surrounding is blinding me
But I'm determined to find the strength within, that's been tucked away deep inside of me

Chorus
My casted wings are almost stubs now
I can't feel a thing, just like you promised
I was always bad at being good
There's no hell more harsh than a memory

Verse 4
So here I stand, trying to stay strong in this storm
I know that I'm not alone and my pain is shared and known
I'll keep pushing forward, until I am whole again
And the darkness will not win against the light in me, amen",rap

Verse 1
On the run, schemin' and ploting, 
Evil eye on the mission and not stoppin'.
His facade is everything, so you can't tell, 
Will he be good or will he be dwelling in hell?
Walking amongst the innocent and blind,
Tricking and deceiving, no one can find.
Condemned to deceive, that's the way he likes it,
For the streets to come alive with all the guns and fights.
Beware of who's next in sight, 
Cause Loki's playing tricks again, Loki's playing tricks again.

Chorus
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Wicked schemes and maliciousness, 
Loki's playing tricks again.

Verse 2
Prowling through the darkness, spreading his mischief and lies,
His darkness is endless, as no one can defy. 
Gunning and aiming to execute his devious plan,
His malice and hatred gaining more than he can.
Loss of control leading him to insanity,
No one can stop him, so humanity weeps in agony.
Uncontrollable powers, no one can prevent,
Loki's playing tricks again, Loki's playing tricks again.

Chorus
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Loki's playing tricks again, 
Wicked schemes and maliciousness, 
Loki's playing tricks again. 

Verse 3
His ""jokes"" bring destructive chaos and death,
No one can understand the burden of his breath.
Gripping the darkness with a devilish grin,
He knows he's won and a new evil shall begin.
Unpredictable mind and heart of ice,
He's here to stay as he's playing tricks again, Loki's playing tricks again.

Come along and take a stroll with me
I need all of y'all to see what I see
Time is short and I must hurry
It's a trek that I must carry
Through this land of hope and despair
Lookin' at what's really there
See the people livin' on the street
How it's making their life so bleak

Chorus 
Come and take a walk with me
See what I'm going through, can you feel it?
See the truth for yourself and you will see
Come and take a walk with me
If you got time to take a tour with me
Pay attention as I open this door with me

Verse 2
I'm seeing things that I don't like
I'm cautious and feelin' overwhelmed all night
Can't trust these people that I meet
Cause they all got they own ulterior motives
So I'm stuck trying to figure it out
Thinkin' to myself if this is what it's all about
My friends don't know who I am anymore
And it's makin' me feel hollow and so sore

Verse 3
From the club to the church I try to find a way
To show these people that I'm still the same, I just changed
Went from a nobody to somebody real
But on these streets they just don't know how to feel
They see me with a mic, causin' a uproar
Now all these people don't know what's right or wrong no more
And I'm trying to stay strong in this ever-changing scene
Cause this life ain't what it used to be

Come and take a stroll with me,
I want y'all to see what i'm going through,
And I need some opinions of reality,
So if you got time, just a walk with me.
Wait a minute now,
Things ain't like they used to be,
So take a walk and help me see,
My version of reality.
Pay close attention to what I say,
These opinions, I'm trusting you with today,
Cause I don't want to make no mistake,
So let's take a walk and you can make sure I'm straight.

I'm seeing a couple of things wrong,
Sometimes I can't tell what's real and what's wrong,
And I got a feeling that these days ain't done,
So come with me and take a look at what I've become.
Introduce you to my friends and see if you notice,
Are they loyal or is this a faux pas,
Cause these snakes and I are no longer cool,
Not since I got signed, I can't even tell who's true.

These niggas in my hood say they don't like my style,
But that's cool, cause the labels felt my vibe miles,
Where before they didn't even know I existed,
Some cats here ain't even proud of what I've achieved.

Let me know how strongly you feel,
Will I be needing my weapon just to stay real,
Should I carry a pen, write down every suggestion,
Cause in Jersey City it ain't safe, can't make no exceptions.

It's like I can't even trust people close to me,
My baby mama, my boy, is this really how it be,
Is it love or just a different kind of greed,
It's like I'm paranoid, can't tell what they need.

I don't know how I feel anymore,
Ever since I got signed, I can't tell what's real anymore,
These same execs that wanted me,
Don't even care about me, just want to see some spins.

And I don't know how I feel anymore,
Ever since I got signed, I can't tell what's real anymore,
So if you feel me, walk with me,
Cause I could use the help if you see it fit.",rap

Lyrics:
They call me a jerk but I'm just here for fun
My reputation precedes me but I ain't no chump
They know I'm noisy on them streets and layin' up
But I'm just tryin' to get by, ain't no one's gotta shut me up
So I keep doin' the music, got me in a flurry
From east coast to west coast, keeps us in a hurry
Got a bit of fame and I'm livin' it large
Gettin' wild and crazy 'til the break of dawn
So what if I'm out of control at times?
I'm just livin' it up, enjoyin' my prime
Go to the shows, mingle with fans
And then head to the bar to put shots in the cans
From Hollywood to Tennessee, I'm all over the place
Gettin' love from the people and for that, I give thanks
From Rick James to Motley Crue, peace to 'em all
Just keepin' the masses entertained, I won't fall
Got these 15 minutes of fame, gotta hold on tight
Gonna make the most of it, learn from the mistakes of others, let's ride
It's all about the hangovers and late checkout
Gettin' kicked outta clubs, livin' it up with no doubt
No one said it's easy, but it's all worth it
Out in the world, tryin' to make some hits
From the el rey, to the ogden theatre
Just me and the mic, that's how it's supposed to be
With all them cameras, it can be a bit daunting
But I don't play no games, doin' it with no doubtin'
So if you see me out be sure to snap a pic
Cause ain't nobody gonna tell me when I'm done with this
Livin' life to the fullest, I'm gonna Jurney
Never gonna regret it, we gotta keep it goin'
Package the kids face, put it on display
Another national disgrace, wild and livin' it crazy
Gonna keep doin' me, no sense in hatin'
We gonna keep on chewin' the fat, till we can't take it
Hey paparazzi, don't you wanna watch me?
Gonna keep it real, never gonna deceive thee
So what if I'm a little reckless?
Gonna find my dreams, come on, let's enjoy this!",rap
"

They call me a jerk, but I'm just doing me,
I'm rockin' mic in the studio and on the street,
I'm livin' large, that's why they always take my seat
My art of living will never be complete

My lyrics are hard, but I never bite my tongue,
I get it poppin' with an infectious song,
Still livin' large, soaking up the sun,
My 15 minutes of fame have just begun

Haters on watch, wanna knock me down,
But I'ma keep rockin' with a real clown
So they can keep gossiping and put me on blast
But I'm still makin' moves and havin' a blast

I'm rapping for cash, living the life I choose,
To rock the mic, my rhymes got juice,
I'm comin' up on the scene, you should pay me mind,
I'm gonna make it big, that's how I'll find my shine

Got my shades on, looking real cool,
My rhymes are tight, I'm like a jewel,
My rap is fresh and it's phat,
So turnt up, I'm like a rat

Peace to Rick James, Anna Nicole Smith,
Bill Clinton, Motley Crue, whoever you wish,
This goes out to learning from the mistakes of others,
Bring it on, come on, I said come on, I said come on!",rap

Yeah life is like a movie with a script you can’t control,
You’re tryna make it through and find a way to stay whole,
But when the cameras stop, you’re alone and left to cope,
And stuck in a position wishing you were somebody else instead of you.

You want to be a star, but you know the world is cold and harsh,
You try so hard but your efforts, they never get that far,
It all seems like it's set up for failure from the start,
But when the credits roll, the show ain't playing anymore, it's gonna fall apart.

So baby, get the lighter, fill the bathtub with some gas,
Take a kitchen knife and cut your beloved arm off in a flash,
Put the key in your old truck, start the engine and drive away,
As you leave you realize this dead end life is over, no more horrible today.

This horrendous life is over, this horrendous life is done,
This horrendous life is gone, but it ain't ever fucking over, no it ain't ever fucking done.
Grab the wheel and take a chance, try to make a brand new start,
Remember life isn't done, you can always find a way with a little heart.",rap
" 

Verse 1
You think the world's in your hands but life ain't that kind
It's like a book full of secrets, still hard to unwind
You wanna be a star but the truth's hard to take
'Cause all that's left is regret, your dreams you can't make

Chorus
So baby get the toaster, fill the bathtub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall
Or turn your keys in your Ford Focus and as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

Verse 2
Every day you're trying hard, but it's always the same
Your world never changes, you're still in the same game
You want to find a way out but you just can't escape
What's worse than a dead end? Nothing left to save

Chorus
So baby get the toaster, fill the bathtub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall
Or turn your keys in your Ford Focus and as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

Verse 3
Now you can't go back and find that lost time
All those moments you wasted, feeling so sublime
At least you still got your life, it's all you need to live
You can't give up, stand tall and try to give

Chorus
So baby get the toaster, fill the bathtub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall
Or turn your keys in your Ford Focus and as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over

Verse 1
Grind down to the trap house lookin for the person
Got one mission and that is disposin' my opposition
Work like I'm a gangster, but I'm just rappin' for the Internet
Just keep whippin' that wurzel, I got a circle so select
Don't come around if ya cameras is near
Up in the crib, keepin' it all in gear
Clean white money and a little persil
Money gettin higher, while I'm with Virgil

This ain't no practice, I'm the real deal
Big gun like Rick, livin' with Hershel
Gangster gangster, link up with Lisa and Jackie

Gotta buck one banker, play Ken, but a badman Branka

Verse 2
Grabbin' and swervin', turnin' and burnin'
Gettin' to work, like a Kermit, grabbin' and firmen'
Slangin' that Sherman, if I gotta burn
I'ma grab that burner, link up with Buck and Alex in Berlin
Gravity surfin' with all that cavities hurtin'
Man of no mercy, been murkin'
Man are all actors, but now we're convertin' 
Man was all talkin', now we're reversin'",rap

Verse 1:
Whippin' excursion, oh shit I've gotta pick up that person in the trap house
Whippin' that work and you know I'm a real badman I got the gat in my hand
Grabbing that German whip, slanging that Sherman and if man gotta burn then fuck it I'm grabbing that burner
Margiela on my feet and I'm with the Don, flippin' that kush and I'm getting it gone
Ya nah dat man stand for, I'm in an HSB, I just linked up with buck and I'm with Alex in Berlin
Gravity surfing, cavities hurting, man of no mercy, man have been murkin'

Mrs in the crib, you know I'm keeping that fertile
We don't take pictures, you know I'm keeping that personal
White so clean you know I'm flipping that Persil
Soon be the million dollar man like I'm living with Virgil
Real shit this ain't a little rehearsal, big gun like Rick, it's like I'm living with Hershel
Spitting that fire, got it from the source, I'm the yungest in the trap, but I'm the one they endorse
Banging that Kermit, you gotta grab it and firm it
Got a million in my pocket, man don't even try it

Verse 1:
Ain't no stopping me I'm a leader of the pack
I'm here to spread the message a grand plan to attack
The problem at hand lack of knowledge lack of understanding
A barrier of sorts to the ideas we're expanding
It's time we all got together and addressed the situation
What's the truth, the essence, our position and our mission?

Chorus:
So don't be afraid of what you don't know
Let's take this chance to make things grow
Franklin Delano Roosevelt said not to fear
Let's take his words and make it clear
Take precautions, don't be fooled by what appears
Complex situations might bring us tears
But history shows, young minds will come around
Model citizens with no fear of the ground
God bless this great nation, this is the sound!

Verse 2:
Open your eyes and look around at what we've become
A powerful force, with voices that can not be outdone
It's time to leave the isolation, paranoia and fear
A worthy cause to make it all very clear
Be wise and vigilant with the knowledge that you acquire
Set forth your path, be guided by the desire

Chorus:
So don't be afraid of what you don't know
Let's take this chance to make things grow

Verse 1:
Standing in front of the crowd today,
Ain't afraid of a thing, feeling so brave,
From my viewpoint I truly do saw,
The look of hope on their face, they seem so in awe.

That's why I took the mic from the stand,
And told the people bout the plans that I had,
To help the youth, so we don't lose the old,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fear has grown cold.

Chorus:
Paranoia is a disease, be careful who you trust,
A wasted mind is no good, don't let that be a must,
For the youth of today, be sure to pass the word,
Get them on the right track, no more being deferred. 

Verse 2:
From the podium I could feel the intensity,
Answering questions, giving clarity,
Cause what I'm trying to do is really quite grand,
And all should listen, this message is grand.

Won't let anything come between me and success,
Gonna give these people something they can digest,
A youth revolution, a chance of a new,
Time to take the reins, let our voices be heard.

Chorus:
Paranoia is a disease, be careful who you trust,
A wasted mind is no good, don't let that be a must,
For the youth of today, be sure to pass the word,
Get them on the right track, no more being deferred. 

Verse 3:
So come on people, let's make this thing work,
We just gotta show 'em what happens when its done right,
The future of the nation lies in the kids hand,
So everyone join together, take a stand.  

Rise up and be seen, show the world you mean business,
Before you know it, everyone'll be reminiscing,
A new dawn of the youth, something to admire,
So grab onto this dream, set this entire world fire. 

Chorus:
Paranoia is a disease, be careful who you trust,
A wasted mind is no good, don't let that be a must,
For the youth of today, be sure to pass the word,

Verse 1
Everybody gather round now, I'mma paint the picture clear
Of what be creepin' 'round at night when it's midnight round here
Ya neva seen a sight like it, so tight it'll send chills down your neck
Some things lookin' sharp, some with fangs and some no even got no skin yet

Chorus
So we gots to hightail it out of here when the spooks take ova the night
Demons round the corner just waitin' fo' their frightful jamboree to start
The headless horseman's at the top, the one they fear the most
Ya better run if you don't wanna be a headless one, that's right

Verse 2
So now you know the full story, all the creatures come out at night
It's bad enough when they start to party, but it's even worse when the headless one strikes
He's scourin' for a new head, for his old one he got cursed
It don't matter if it's tiny, big or wearin' a wig, it's head he's lookin for at first

Chorus
So we gots to hightail it out of here when the spooks take ova the night
Demons round the corner just waitin' fo' their frightful jamboree to start
The headless horseman's at the top, the one they fear the most
Ya better run if you don't wanna be a headless one, that's right

Verse 3
No matter how scared you are, you should try to make a run
When he comes by you looking fo' a new head, try to head straight to the bridge over the river son
Cause once you cross that bridge take a look back ova ya shoulder
The headless horseman hangs up his curse and the music stops, he's gone in the blink of an eye

Chorus
So we gots to hightail it out of here when the spooks take ova the night

Verse 1
Now let me tell you a story about a spook that's cursed
From the bowels of Hades, the headless horseman burst
He's searching for a head to swap, he don't get no respect
He's so unappreciated, he's ready to give it all up

Chorus
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So make for the bridge with all your might
For once you cross that bridge, his power ends tonight!

Verse 2
He takes no prisoners, riding through the night
He'll take your head if you don't make it to the bridge in time
He'll take it if its little, or big, or if it's red
He's on the prowl to find a head and there's nothing he won't do to get it

Chorus
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So make for the bridge with all your might
For once you cross that bridge, his power ends tonight!

Verse 3
The dead are up to no good and Halloween night is when
They get together for their jamboree, so you'd better listen in
There's demons, banshees and ghosts, so beware and take care
Be sure to make it to the bridge before the headless horseman's there!

Chorus
No spooks like a spook who's spurned
So don't try to figure out a plan

No spooks like a spook who's spurned

Verse 1
You say one thing, do another, don't know which one to trust
You've kept your head low, love a lie more than the truth
You said the sky but the ground is all that I see
Everytime you come around you try to bring me to my knees

Chorus
So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

Verse 2
You said that you would stay, but said goodbye in the end

You said it's all love, but I see evil in your eyes
Why can't you just tell it like it is, tell me the truth and not disguise?

Chorus
So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

Verse 3
You say you care but I can see it's all just pretend

The love I felt for you was nothing but a sham
And now I'm standing here all alone, I can't believe I was so damn naive

Though you keep saying ""go, go""
Your hands still grasp me tight

Everything I had, you chose to forsake
I'm not gonna be the one that has to break

Chorus
I won't be the one to leave it in pieces
You'll be alone with your secrets and regrets
Don't lie, you promised me the sky but threw me like a stone
You embraced me with your arms, chillin' to the bone
I won't be the one to leave it in pieces

Now I'm tryin' to be brave and just walk away
But I'm still left where I always been
Your words mix like puzzle pieces, never fit the same
Why did you mislead me when some of it was true?
Your lies blindside me and I'm left feeling blue
And I'm not gonna be the one to destroy this view

Don't lie, you promised me the sky but threw me like a stone

Verse 1
God had another plan for me, to make somethin' out of nothing, my life under control, I gotta hustle 'til I find prosperity.
Gonna get it by any means, paper chase I never quit, stay up all night up in the streets stayin' true to it.
Put in work no sympathy, I don't give a damn 'bout your feelings, put in points on the board yeah that's what I'm believing.

Verse 2
My foot is on the gas, I'm never slowing down, I don't care what they say I'm gonna show 'em I'm a king in this town.
I don't need no body to get ahead, I'm gonna make it on my own, I'll never be fooled again by lies and false promises.

Chorus

Do your thing just be safe with it.

I'm gonna bust these moves, I'm gonna stay alive, no matter what I do I'm gonna survive.
I'm gonna keep fighting 'cause I'm the last of the greats, I'm gonna show the world how to be strong and unbreakable.

Verse 4
Focused and determined, don't let anyone tell you what to do, it's in your heart and in your soul, so be you.
Time don't stop for nobody, gotta take control and make it yours, hustle hard 'cause it ain't no such thing as free money.

My heart thumpin out my chest, my dreams lookin like a wreck
My enemies stalkin' my steps, I'm seein' double like I'm on deck
And I know that I'm on my own, but I don't fear the unknown
Struggle's around every corner, I'm always never alone
My friends be on some snake shit, tryna turn a deaf ear
I said peace and love to the hood, but they don't hear

Verse 2
Thinkin' back when I was young, I'd rather hit the streets with my homies
Than go to school and do my studies, man I didn't know I was so lonely
Sippin' Ripple with the OG's, tryna stay off the radar
And I remember I used to dream of the time where I could make this rap thing bigger
But I had to break free from the box, 'cause I knew that I had something to offer
So I took it to the next level, put in the work and worked it like a jobber
It got harder as I got older, had to pay bills, take care of momma
But I told myself you'll never fail without tryin' and never be a quitter

Blue laces in my blue Chucks, I never gave two fucks

Verse 3
Look at my life, look at the screams, look at the pain, look at the tears
Look at the hustle, look at the grind, look at the laughs, look at the cheers
And I said to myself, don't forget where you came from, never forget your purpose
Dust off your shoes, pick yourself up, and keep it movin', don't lose your focus
Victory to me is when you get your mind right, thinkin' and dreamin' of life
Inspiration to stay true to the game, doin' what I do, a real hustler's life
And I'll keep it real, I'ma do my thing, rep for the hood and the upper echelon
At the end of the night, no matter the fight, I'ma look for the diamonds in the sky",rap

Man man, I'll tell ya, I don't know what to say
That's how it's goin' down, creepin round the way
Ridin' in my old school Lincoln, takin' shots of Hennessy
Music bumpin loud, no need for company
Peepin out the window, man I had to stay alert
Lookin for some girls to holla and flirt
Lookin for a come-up, ain't no time to rest
Searchin for a way to stack up a fresh check
I hopped out in the street, smokin' on a joint
Gettin loose and keepin' it trill, I'm never disappoint
Throw ya hands in the air, if you rock with me
We don't need friends cause we livin' life carefree
I made my way to the club, time to make some pick-ups
Drinkin' lots of liquor, I'm feelin' kinda lit up
Shakin' it with a dime, I can tell she dig me
She wants the rough stuff, I'm gonna hit it quickly
It's kinda late, so I parked the Brougham
Time to take her back to the hotel and let her explore what I have
Headed straight to her room, layin' it on the bed
Time to make moves while the bass is pumpin in my head
Hit the lights and that's when the freakin' began
Gettin' real wild, the freak was too much for the man
Call it a night when the sun started to beam
Back out to the street, for the mission I must dream
Back to my mission, back to my mission
Lookin' for the green, strugglin' for the bread
Takin' out my foes, leakin' out the dread
Stickin' to the plan, no time for mistakes
Gettin' closer and closer I'm sees a way to escape

Reachin' out for the light, got rid of the cash
Mean muggin' all who come in my path
Gatherin' my team, searchin' for more dough
No time to lose, got to keep that flow
Dippin' and dodgin', tryin' not to get caught
Let 'em talk, just cause they mad they can't stop
Goin' hard, never give up the fight
Always reachin' for the dream, takin' over the night

Back to my mission, back to my mission
Rollin' with my squad, doin' our thing
Spittin' hot fire, nothin' but the cream
Workin' for the bread, never break the bank
Still in the field and not a penny to thank
Money comin' in, livin' the real life
Takin' it to the limit, never runnin' from strife
Makin' moves, no time to rest
Ain't nothing stoppin' me, I'm just doin' my best
Gettin' closer to the top, the ultimate goal
Ain't no turnin' back, gotta keep control
Back to my mission, back to my mission",rap

Bringing in cash flow never slackin' it's facts
Put it in the bank or put it in my stash
And make sure that I'm fresh when I'm riding in my '83
Pull up at the club and I'm dripping in gold
From my chains to my rings I'm always rockin' a show
Steppin' out the whip like I'm ready to rage
I'm look'n like a king like I'm found in a cage
My girls they know me wherever I go
They always comin' around just to get a dose
Of the way I move when I'm steppin' out
Gettin' money from the east to the west I'm 'bout
I grab my hoe come the club around eight
Start the evening off with a blunt and a plate
Hit the floor with the homies and we movin' it fast
Get the crowd hype and we bout to have a blast
My pimp talk is always on point it's so true
I'm that dude thats always puttin' in work
From the low key spot to the local strip joint
I'm at the party livin' it loud, gettin' it joint
Smokin' a blunt and sippin' a drink
Get the crowd jumpin' and the DJ spinnin'
Gonna show respect and get the ladies praise
My rap flows and my rhymes gonna light the stage
Movin' the ladies with the way I'm lurkin' it
Spit that game and they know they gonna hear it
Gettin' that respect 'cause I'm poppin' out
Never stoppin' until I get it right what it's all about

I still remember the days of old,
Riding hot wheels and playing tag on the road.
From low riders to the boom box,
Spinning the Gangstarr and Kid n Play, never stopped.
It was all about reeboks and high tops,
The girls in their deep blue jeans, rocking out with the hip hop.
The neighborhood was live, never a dull moment,
Explosions of peace, love, and unity we often sent.

Time flies so fast, it's like a blink of an eye,
The rap game changed, and moved up and got higher.
We were bboys, with the bgirls,
Coming up with new moves, in our own world.
Keeping it real and never faking,
The Wu Tang Clan, Tribe Called Quest, and KRS-One, always shaking.
It's like the rides in amusement parks,

Now, all I have left are the memories of days gone by,
The physical things have faded, but the music still survives.
So, when I look back, I'll never forget,
The fact that I can still hear the beat gave me no regrets.
It's all for the love of hip hop and I will always cherish, 
May it keep growing and we'll never perish.

Droppin' rhymes I'ma keep it real, I'ma spill it out
A story of a struggle, I'ma give no doubt
So grab a seat and listen to a tale of woe
'Bout a life of crime, when those around me chose to go

I was once a king, a hustler, a G
My moves were shady, but I kept it discreet
Now I'm in the joint, incarcerated for the crime
Prayin' for the day that I could make it out alive

But I'm not alone, cuz' my fellas all stuck too
We're all facin' sentence, none of us could make it through
No actin' tough, instead we stuck to the truth
So bein' in this joint, it's startin' to get to me and you

One love, one love, oh yeah one love
One love, one love, it's what we dream of
One love, one love, yeah yeah one love
It's all we've got, hey one love

I got new rules comin' at me all day
My freedom taken away, but I don't feel dismay
Cuz I've got my word, it's the only thing I'll ever trust
Won't back down or turn around, I'll keep my head held high up

On my cell wall I've got some pictures of the past
My folks, my girls, and my crew that I knew that would last
And although I'm in here, my heart's still in the street
No need for me to cry, I'ma keep it steady, keep it neat

One love, one love, oh yeah one love
One love, one love, it's what we dream of
One love, one love, yeah yeah one love
It's all we've got, hey one love

Been here for years and it's still hard to accept
Especially when I miss my family and their visits
I got friends on the outside still keepin' it true
They hit me up with news and keep me up to date too

Life moves on but I'm still stuck in the past
I pray one day I'ma make it out and I'm free at last
So let's hit the streets and raise our glasses to the sky
So if you hear me speak, don't forget that one love never dies

One love, one love, oh yeah one love
One love, one love, it's what we dream of
One love, one love, yeah yeah one love
It's all we've got, hey one love",rap

Verse 1
I swing by the block, my homies all post up
My potnas upstate, got their own set up 
My cousin don't call, I'm itchin' to hear somethin' 
So I reach out, get a collect call from the precinct 
No more beef and pork, they got no mercy
H.U.D. steel, they want it urgent 
P.O. says ""you better check yourself""
Momma's in the hood prayin'in the 12 steps

Chorus 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 

Verse 2
Though times were tough, we were still stayin' alive
We be out choppin' game, conversatin' 'bout gettin' toast up 
Too much money, too much fame, everybody want a piece of the pie 
But my cousin, he done wild out, he was sent to a California State Prison

Bridge 
Though I can't be there, I'm havin' his back 
My pappy sent a box full of goodies, and it's a fact 
Through the good and the bad, keep the faith alive 
Shed a tear for the ones who have taken this long ride 

Chorus 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 
One love, one love, oh ohh, one love 
One love, one love, well well, one love 

Verse 3
My homies still livin' life, they all doing their thing
Gettin' money in the hood, and that's everything 
Live by the lyrics, swear to God, it's all real
Sometimes I gotta keep it gangsta on a next level

Bridge 
My homies got my back, they stay true 
One love, one love, never forgot who
Yaah, one love, one love, yeah yeah yeah 
One love, one love, never forget

Back in the spot where I flow so divine
Droppin' bars so I'm shinin' like a diamond
Hit the mike with some lyrical bliss 
Stay fly when I'm speakin' like a G
My hood know what it is, my homegirls cuttin' up
Drippin' sauce like its on shut even when it’s going up
I'm just flexin' like I'm spittin’ hot fire
Neva miss when I'm kickin' that empire
Everybody going crazy when they hear me kick it 
Start to reminisce when they hear my silky wicked wit

When I'm in your town tell em turn me way up way way up
Way up way up way way way up

Yea, I can go for days with rhymes so pure
Delivering flames that's hotter than a tour
Ain't nothing like the feeling when you owning the stage
All the ladies got me feeling like a new age
My crew know I'm never trippin' when it comes to the flow
My bars hotter than the desert but I got a cold soul
Take a sip and let it hit your brain
Makin' hits when I'm in the hood cause I'm known to be insane

Haters try to get me so I had to go off
My flow too hard and won't nothing stop me ever
Spittin' bars that make 'em go so stupid
I got the keys to the city and they can never lock it
They say I'm the king and they know I'm the plug
This rap life ain’t easy, but homeboy I'm in love
Ridin' round town with the top down, yeah I drip it
And when I'm at the spot they know my name, it's a given

Verse 1:
I'm going in the studio late night, never miss a beat
I got my rhyme book and a blue loose leaf
Ain't no one gonna mess with me when they see the heat
It's time to cook up in this kitchen, frying up the street
Evil tweaks the beat and he makes it alright
Cause when he samples it's a stupid dope loop right
But that record's kinda old, we gotta clean it up tight
Try'd the rubbing alcohol, even used the ivory soap
It's still crackling, but it's so damn dope
Gonna give up and let Evil E. hit it with the fried chicken
Verse 2:
Now it's time to bring my flow to the rhyme
Gonna make it hot, get your bodies in line
Put your hands up and take the time to shine
Cause when I start rapping I put you in a daze
Beats so fire, can't be touched by the blaze
Gonna lay it down like I'm lyrically born
And my words gonna come out like a storm
Ain't no one gonna touch my crown
I'm the king of rap, gettin' props all around
Verse 3:
I'm gonna keep spittin' fire like a volcano
Gonna write the lyrics and make the beat flow
Got that funky sound, keeps the party going
So get up and move ya hips to the rhyme
It won't take much to rock your mind
I'm the G.O.A.T. so you can't deny
Gonna stay in control and never lose power
Cause I'm the ruler of this rap tower",rap

My pen and pad, I got it ready, its time to attack
Gotta get this track poppin' like a peach, off the bat
Evil E's on the beat, got the room rockin'
Gotta tune it up, better make it thumpin'
Try rubbing it down, and scrub it up with soap
Gotta get it sounding crispy and fresh, like D'Angelo's album

Chorus:
Time to hit the studio, and cut a track,
Gotta make it pop, and get the people to react
My rhyme book in hand, gotta strike while the iron's hot
Gonna make this beat jump, make it bang like a pot
Can't forget the fried chicken on the side,
Gonna munch on some while I ride

Verse 2:
Coming with the flow, its time to ignite
Gonna make this beat go hard, til the people get hype
Jump off the beat, gonna make it bounce
Take it back to the old school, like its 85
Come through with the bars, gonna have 'em impressed
Keep it on point like a ballerina's dress
Can't forget the fried chicken, its time to eat
Gonna take a break, fill up the beat

Chorus:
Time to hit the studio, and cut a track,

The valet park me when I pull up, no need for talking, they already know what's up
If a nigga don't pay, then we pull up on him, no one's getting out of this, unless you want to swim
My momma taught me, money's the key, been getting money since I was in pull ups
I got shooters, they in the sunroof, they ready to go and they do what I do
My white girls twerking Miley Cyrus, got my money up and I'm feeling alive
I'm rocking all my chains in the club, I'm getting mobbed, that's too much love
My ride's colder than the winter, the bitches wanna know where I get my mink from
Throw a party, I'm showing out, got the money, got the power, I'm the man without a doubt

My rhymes are so cold that it's like icicles on the shore
From Ye Olde England to all the way to Spain, this music's got me going to the max
Ain't nobody gonna stop me or my flow, so it's time to let them all know
That when I'm writing these bars, my words just go 'round and 'round
I can make a beat fit for a king, 'cos when I'm spinning it's the hottest sound

The rhythm takes control and my thoughts begin to unfurl
Like the wings of a dove, they spread far and wide throughout the world
My music's so powerful, it'll make your edges curl
Jump up and start to dance, 'cos I'm the king of the rap whirl

Stick with me, it's all the way to the top
I'm like a fly on the wall, got an eye on the clock
My beats are the flame and my words provide the spark
And when I'm on the mic, it's that special kind of art

From abstract ideas to nouns and verbs
My rap is way ahead of its words
Pouring out like a waterfall, my rhymes got that funk
And when I'm in the booth, I just bring it to the brink

It's the haiku and pottery, the French and the pirate
The John Waters mustache and the unicorn's might
There's never a dull moment and never a bore
My rhymes are like a wave of heat, 'cos I bring it all the more

And I'm pouring it all out with a lyrical touch
So don't just sit and watch, jump in the rap fray

See, them other guys they pay they minds to your physical features
But I can admire your body, but your mind's much deeper
And I found me a keeper, a winner and a queen

Black Mother of the Earth, you know I forever owe ya
Never gonna ignore ya cuz I'm forever loyal

Black card at the bar like I gives a f**k
Ladies shifty eyed when we walk into the set 
F**k the fellas looking jealous play that back and get wet 
Three pound at my waist shank in my sock 
You either get cut get stuffed or get shot

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
A pirate so brave on the seven seas
A mystical quest to the isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean breeze

Then we're back in the club buying up the bar
So the groupies show us love motherf**king iceman
I'm the Top Gunner heater on blast
I'm the number one stunner watch your girl cause I ain't your mister nice guy 
More like the meet you take you home and f**k you twice guy
All dressed up with nowhere to run that's how I make you feel crazy when I come 

From the day he was born he yearned for adventure
Oh Captain Jack giving them what for 
He's the pauper of the surf the jester of Tortuga
But in Davy Jones locker what lies in store

Put your hands in the air and say hell yeah
Come on Captain Jack what Johnny Depp no
From the front to the back say we count stacks
Come on Davy Jones nope giant squid wrong
Michael Bolton we really gonna need you to focus up

Roger that let me try with another film
Life is a box of chocolates and my name is Forrest Gump
Though I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
I gave Jenny all my love okay then

I'm a legal aide Erin Brockovich is my name
Then you can call me Scarface snorting mountains of cocaine
You cockroaches wanna play rough okay I'm reloaded ha ha
So put your hands in the air and say yeah yeah

Yo yo it's Michael Bolton damn what a show
The lyrics were hot and the beats were cold
From the Captain Jack to Scarface Tony
Everybody knows Michael Bolton is the only

Now the night is young and I'm just getting started
We gonna tear the roof off the club like brokenhearted 
Mama always said life's a box of chocolates
But now I rock the mic and the audience they watch it
So get out of my way I'm gonna be a star
And I'm gonna light up the night like a shooting star",rap

Verse 1
My life's a game I'm tryna master
The voice in my head is a drama catcher
Feelin' like I'm livin' a disaster
Paranoia's grasp is faster, faster, faster
My thoughts clashin' round in my mind
Trying to figure out what's wrong and what's right
Hear the voice of worry echoing night
It's a face I can't open or break, locked tight

Chorus
It's like I'm paranoid lookin over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Verse 2
Never want to be a puppet to this force
But it's like I'm livin' life on the short course
Gotta find my way out of this mental divorce
Feelin' like a prisoner locked behind bars, of course
My skin crawls with worry and fright
At night I just stare into the night
Every day I'm trying to do what's right
But in the end it's the face inside that's mine

Chorus
It's like I'm paranoid lookin over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Verse 3
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a slave
To this fear of the unknown I've been given
Gotta take back control like a wave
Cause in the end, livin' with fear is just a prison
So I close my eyes, I take a deep breath
Tell myself I'm gonna conquer this mess
Say goodbye to the pains that test
And I keep going with the face inside of me

Chorus
It's like I'm paranoid lookin over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin",rap
"

Verse 1:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
All these fears and paranoia,
I'm drownin' in a sea of sorrow
What stressed me first or how the pressure was fed?
I'm tryin' to keep my head above water, like I'm treadin'
Had a voice in my head that I could not ignore
A face I held inside, like a ghost right at my door
It laughed at every mistake, every time I'd fall
It was like a devil chasin' my steps, not gonna let me ball

Chorus:
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Verse 2:
The pressure was on, I felt so stressed
Everybody had a face they held inside, but for me it was the best
The face inside was like a curse, wakin' every time I'd dream
The face inside was laughin' every time I'd scream
I heard it laughin', but I couldn't control my fear
The only way out was to get away from here
So I looked for a way, a way to let it go
So I made a choice, and I started to grow

Chorus:
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Bridge:
It's like I can't fight what I hear within
It's like the face I hold inside is right beneath my skin
The sun goes down, I feel the light betray me
I'm tryin' to block the sound of the face inside of me

Outro:
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin",rap

[Verse 1]
I was out of it, had a one-track mind
Rocking on my grind just to make some time
Had to get back home to the city I love
Ain't had time to rest when hell's rising above
So I said a prayer, had a puff of smoke
Ate a plate of greens just to stay afloat
Hit the streets like I'ma kill the beat
Cause it's all too familiar, I'm a king of deceit

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day in the hood
Beautiful day for the fam
Won't you come and be mine
Good morning sunshine

[Verse 2]
Lifestyle on lock, high speed no stops
Let the bass drop and the beats rock
Profiling in style, briskin' to the store
Ain't no time for sleepin' when money's to be earned
Living good, yea I can't complain
Feeling like a king, always standing in fame
No time for passed out nights
Right or wrong, I got to keep it tight

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day in the hood
Beautiful day for the fam
Won't you come and be mine
Good morning sunshine

[Verse 3]
Gotta stay focused, dynamite dreams no joke
Hustling hard, got a fire in my soul
Buildin' my empire, don't care who's wrong or right
Watch me turn it up, gimme some neon lights
Been doubted but never stopped striving
Livin' high, rollin' dice, all that I'm reviving
Riding solo, but it's all good because
I'm surrounded by love, it's my beautiful hood, yo",rap

Chorus
Gotta get my fill when I feel myself
I'm talking morning sex, man, I need it like hell
Living the single life with no one to call
Gotta stay positive, no matter how small

Verse 1
My head's in the clouds, my feet on the ground
I'm looking for someone just to lay me down
Ain't no girlfriend, ain't got no wife
Ain't no friends around, 'less there's trouble in sight
I'm walking alone on the dark side of town
And I ain't sure if I'm gonna make it back around
So I keep my eyes looking for that special someone
Who knows just how to make me feel warm when I'm feeling low

Verse 2
Open my window I see the starlight
The way it shines just makes everything feel so right
I get dressed and head to the club this evening
I'm on the prowl, hope I might find something interesting
My heart is pounding, man it feels like thunder
Ain't afraid to make a move, yeah I'm feeling hungry
I see her in the corner, she's so beautiful
She smiles and my soul feels like it will never cool

Chorus
Gotta get my fill when I feel myself
I'm talking morning sex, man, I need it like hell
Living the single life with no one to call
Gotta stay positive, no matter how small

Verse 3
She took me back to her place, nothing else to do
We laid there talking, can't believe it was real
Took her hand and moved in closer, just felt like a dream
My heart was beating faster, felt like everything was about to change
We talked for hours 'til the sun began to rise
We tried to sleep but we just couldn't deny it
Finally she spoke and said, ""Let's just roll the dice
Let's make something real, something beautiful and nice""

Chorus
Gotta get my fill when I feel myself
I'm talking morning sex, man, I need it like hell
Living the single life with no one to call

Ain't no faking it when I'm in the scene, I'm the king
These hoes be sleeping with me, it's the way that I sing

You need a piece of my team, so come at me and scream

Jump in my flow and we can smoke and drift away
Blow up the speakers, the sound's gonna make you sway
So much money in this game, man, I can't explain
Just hop in my Benz and we can cruise on some of this champagne

Got a few girls, they ain't all alike
But they all know how to dance and give it life
Big body Benz, on the roads, no lights
On top of the game, that's where I reside

Money's my motivation, that's what I'm hustling for
Better watch out, I'ma take it to the floor
Can you feel the vibe, that's what I'm on
Got the rap game on lock, and I'm getting it on
