Ride on my pony, ride to the fields,
Watch the sun rise on a summer day.
The sweet smell of the flowers that bloom,
Gives me a feeling that won't go away.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses,
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.

Trot on the river, trot on the lake,
Dance with the wind in an open space.
The stars light the way in the middle of the night,
Giving us light, a magical place.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses, 
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.",country
" 

Passing through that Colorado town, I'm tryin' to make it Oklahoma, 
Just one more stop along the way, then I know I'm gonna make it alright
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as fast as I can.

Rollin' on down the dusty road, my wheels are spinning 'neath the sun,
Smells of coal, smokestack's high, with a load I gotta get done
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

I've been livin' on the road, I got no time for a plan,
The highway's my home and my bed, that's where I'll lay my head 
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

The sky is dark, the stars have come, a bright moon shinin' through,
My wheels keep spinning 'til the night, and I'll be coming home soon
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.",country

Verse 1
A Wednesday morn in the hills of Tennessee 
The wind's a comin' and the cotton's white and clean 
The sun's a shinin', and the birds are singing their song 
And the morning dew can't hide the silence of the dawn 

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Verse 2
A family's home washed away by the raging storm 
A farmer's crop burned up in the heat of the morn 
The road's a river, and the bridge is washed away 
And the echoes of the thunder heard for miles away

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Bridge
The valley's just a whisper, the rolling hills alive 
The farms in tatters and the truth we can't hide 
The songbird's singing of a time we must face 
The judgement of the Lord in a broken land of grace

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day",country

Verse 1
I wake up in the morning, dawning light shone in
With a heavy heart and hurt I can't contain
My arms reach out, searchin' for you in my sleep
But the thunder claps in my soul as I remember you gone

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Verse 2
I head down to the bar, tryin' to drink away my blues
Laughter rings and I shoot some pool with friends, for a moment I'm okay
But when the night closes in and it's just me, oh Lord, I'm overwhelmed
Then I remember that you're not here and deep pain starts to swell

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Bridge
I cry out to the night sky, seeking some kind of sign
But the silence is deafening, your absence is all that I find
And I straighten Miss Emily's picture one last time

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then",country

Verse 1
I was strolling down the street one day,
Thought I'd find some love, nothing to pay,
Saw a girl who looked so fine,
I just couldn't leave her behind.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 2
She said meet me round the corner at half past ten,
Thought my heart would cry, but I went in,
Her room was a place I'd never been,
But something told me I ought to go in.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 3
I thought I'd take her out and buy her a meal,
Naive as a puppy and dammed as a seal,
I thought 'twas true love, but I had it wrong,
I was just another part of her song.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Bridge
Been around the block a few times, now I see the light,
Ain't gonna be fooled again, not by no one tonight,
Gonna find a gal who wants me,
And who knows what real love can be.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.",country

Verse 1 
We left our expectations back on the shoreline 
Took off our worries, left 'em behind 
The sun was settin' low, but the water was so inviting 
We just had to take the risk and take the dive 

Chorus
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions  
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Verse 2 
The night was starry bright, it enveloped us in grace 
The moonlight guided us to a safe place 
No fear of judgement here, 'cause noone could ever see 
We just had to keep believin' and keep our faith 

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions 
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Bridge 
We'll keep on swimmin', in this crystal-clear lake 
We can keep it to ourselves, forever and ever, forever and ever 
And when the waters call us, we'll rise again 
We'll keep on swimmmin', keep our feet on solid ground

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions

Verse 1
I was lost and out of luck,
Searching all the backroads for love
Breaking all the rules, that I made up
Leaving only dust and broken dreams

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Verse 2
Thought I’d never find someone like you
Every stoplight and bar had something to do
Running around, losing again and again
But now I know it was all for a reason

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Bridge
You showed up just in time and knocked on my door
Brought with you sweet sunshine and love evermore
No more searching for love in all the wrong places
God bless the day I discovered you lookin’ for love

Chorus
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about
Now that I’ve found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered you, oh you lookin’ for love",country

Verse 1
The mountain seems so high, with obstacles in my way
I'm struggling to stay strong, so I can make it through the day
I'm reminded of His grace, and of His constant love
He's been here from the start, and will be with me from above

Chorus 
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Verse 2
No matter where I turn, whatever I'm going through
I'm reminded of His Word, and of the hope He gives anew
He'll never forsake me, no matter how I stray
The Lord remains by side, no matter what the cost may be

Chorus
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Bridge
And I will always trust, His promise is sure
His faithfulness will never pass, He's a light that will endure
His mercy never fails, He's by my side when I fall
I know that God is always here, and He'll never leave me at all

Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 2:
Belshazzar's heart was filled with fear
The writing said time was running out
But Daniel held his hand and said,
""Your kingdom shall soon be overthrown""

The writing said his rule had come to an end
The king's fate lay in Daniel's hands
He must surrender the throne to Darius
And to the Lord he must make amends


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 3:
The warning had been given loud and clear
And Belshazzar heeded the call
To avoid the wrath of the Lord
He must give up his throne to all

But Belshazzar's pride and his ignorance lingered still
And he refused to give up his reign
Vengeance was swift and it came with a roar
His kingdom fell and would never be the same


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Outro:
Belshazzar's demise was a lesson for all
Pride goes before a fall
His arrogance was his own downfall
He should've learned to heed the warnings of old",country

Verse 1
It started with a smile, a twinkle in your eye
The way you said my name and how you made me feel alive
But when I was young and naive, I didn't see the signs
And now I'm left to wonder when the truth will be mine

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 2
The lies and secrets that you kept, I still feel betrayed
You took my trust and cast it aside, like it was some kind of game
Was all just part of your plan, lead me on while you can
You might have thought I would fall down, but I'm still rolling on

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 3
You thought you had me fooled, but I'm wiser than you think
Took me for a fool, but still I rise above you
You might have thought I'd give up, but I'm staying strong
I won't let go, this fight is not about to end

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Bridge 
You can't ignore the truth, no matter how hard you try
It's a part of me, and it's here to stay
There's no need to keep trying to turn back the time
I'm moving forward, no more games to play

Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong

Verse 1
I am a young woman livin' in small town Tennessee
My old man works hard all day, just to keep us fed
If wishes were horses and dreams were made of steel
I'd drive this rutted road away to something better than I feel

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 2
They say living's easy now, compared to times before
But all that changes when I'm down here on the floor
I don't want no silver spoon, or a mansion on a hill
I just want a steady job, and someone who'll love me still

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 3
They say there's a brighter day, down a long and winding road
But I can't seem to get there, like I'm stuck in heavy snow
I don't want no fortune, or a bigger pile of gold
Just one thing to keep me going, so I can stay on this road

Make me an angel, who flies from town to town

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares 
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Driving in the night, heading for the light
Feeling free like I'm in flight
Gonna make it through, not gonna be like you
Ain't gonna be your fool no more

Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
Gonna lose your shirt when you dive
Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
I'm the king of the hive

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, like I'm in sin
Blow away all of your cares
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Can't control no more, can't take it like before

Say goodbye to this train, gonna start living again
No I won't be your fool no more

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares

Is hard for us all when we can't hold our own
They talked about us livin' in despair

Verse 1 
Drivin' down the highway, starin' out the window,
Livin' on the lost side of town, feelin' so far away from home.
My heart is runnin' faster, I can't keep still,
I won't admit defeat, tryin' to regain control on this endless wheel.

I can find myself a woman, but no ring could ever be heavy enough,

Rustlin' in the wind, I've been through my darkest days,
The sun can't penetrate the cloud that's been hangin' over me since yesterday.

All hope feelin' so distant as I gave up my fight.

I woke up this mornin' to a dawn so bright,
Heard a bird singin' in the apple tree.
Listenin' to the whisperin' of the wind,
Singin' 'bout a life I once used to live.

Lost my way, just tryin' to find a place to go.
I was lost in my mind, not sure which way to go.
Life can take you down a path so dark,
Still tryin' to find some hope in the dark.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

Hope is hard to find when faith is hard to keep.
And love is hard to find when nobody believes.
Sometimes life can be so cruel, and hard to take,
Still tryin' to find that light to break.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on livin' my life,
Searchin' around for that silver light.
The only way to find my hope and way,
Is to keep prayin' that someday I'll be OK.

Verse 1:
If you see her out tonight, she'll act so strong and standing tall
But in the depths of her heart lies a vulnerability that she'll keep hidden away
She's been broken before, and so now it's hidden behind the wall
And she'll tell you she's alright and she won't need a man tonight, that's what she says

Chorus:
But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets
And not too long ago she swore she'd never let her heart be broken anymore

Verse 2:
Living on a fragile edge, she's trying to stay away from the heartache
But a little bit of love could make her feel alive
Holding on despite the pain, in silent hopes of a brighter tomorrow
But no one knows that she's been longing for a little tenderness

But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets

Red and orange sparks dancing across the pond tonight

Baby we're getting out of here, I could care less where it leads us
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight

Let's head on down this lonesome road, no need for second thoughts
Two hearts living for the moment, ain't no room for nothin else

Verse 1

I've seen a ghost of a faded moonbeam,
As it moved across my windowpane,
Tossing and turning in the chilly night air,
The rain as it was washing away my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 2

Looking at the tracks of the careless windbeam,
Or moving to the tracks of the tireless freight train,
Lit up the sides of the weathervane,
As the bits of rain and the windowpane,
Took away my hopes and my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 3

I've looked for the moonbeam, as it flew away,
Taken away by the summer breeze,
But the ghost of my dreams still lingers on,
As I search for the light of the moonbeam.

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,

I've been wandering on a road so long, 
Open skies my only home, 
But I've never felt so lost and so alone, 
Until I found a new way to roam.

Ain't know how to take back control, 
I heard a voice it made me change, 
I ain't ashamed to let you know.

When the struggle is so hard,
Follow the dreams, keep searchin for the truth,
The answers waiting for you in your heart.

So many trials, all along the way, 
Battles coming from all sides, 
Willie's voice, gives me strength to stay, 
Like a miracle he saw me through the night.

And I know what would Willie do, 
If he was here for me now,
He'd smile so strong and take me by the hand, 
And show me a better way somehow.

Snappy new jeans and her boots all tight

Got no reason to care what anyone's thinkin'

The sun sets in the west, and I see the spark in your eyes
As you turn around and whisper, we found a special kind of love

And I'm calling out your name in the night 
Begging you to come back, make it right
Take my hand and I'll never let go, sweet Ophelia

Chorus:
Tell me, what went wrong? Was it something that somebody said?
Mama, I know we broke the rules, were somebody up against the law?
Honey, you know I'd die for you, why must the best things disappear?
Like Ophelia, please darken my door again",country

Ah, out here in the country, things all move a bit slower
Life, it ain't so demanding and that's good for me and her
We take it one step at a time, no sense to hurry up
And with our hearts wide open, nothing can fill us up

Chorus:
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Ah, out here in the country, ain't nobody pushing us
Time heals all wounds, if you just let it do its thing
So don't let your heart be shoved, but just let it wander free
Take a breath and relax, don't let nobody rush thee

Chorus:
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Ah, in the country, we ain't trying to be no star
Just get to know one another and have a good time, yeah
So baby, just give it time and let the love grow strong
Nothing can keep us apart, when the journey's oh so long

Chorus:
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby",country

Verse 1 
It's been quite a while since I last saw your face 
I replay all the moments, can't find my place 
I never really knew when it all went wrong 
It's too late to reverse, it won't be long 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head 
Way back when the world was young 
Long before this song was sung 
I know someone must have hurt like me 

Verse 2 
Tried my best to please you, you took my love for granted 
Cried my eyes out for you, but you never changed it 
I don't regret the day I laid my eyes on you 
But I regret the way I lost my point of view 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head 
Way back when the world was young 
Long before this song was sung 
I know someone must have hurt like me 

Bridge 
No one can tell me why I keep hanging on 
Can't unlock the feelings I can't seem to move on 
Once I thought I'd never be the same again 
But I kept on living, it's not the end 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head 
Way back when the world was young 
Long before this song was sung 
I know someone must have hurt like me 
But I'll keep on believing in the morning I'll be free",country

Verse 1
My life has been a broken round, 
Full of trials and no peace to be found. 
Never understood the why or the how, 
But I’d search for an answer right now.

Chorus
A rose for affection and a thorn for my heart, 
Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start. 
I run in the night, I wait in the light, 
In shadows of darkness, and music I recite. 

Verse 2
A letter by the door, I thought that it was more, 
Cashmere for the weather and wool for the cold. 
A bed made of feathers, my mask made of lies, 
My broken soul drowning in a sea of goodbye. 

Chorus
A rose for affection and a thorn for my heart, 
Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start. 
I run in the night, I wait in the light, 
In shadows of darkness, and music I recite. 

Bridge
Champagne for my sorrow, I sip from the glass, 
My life is full of choices, but none ever lasts. 

Chorus
A rose for affection and a thorn for my heart, 
Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start. 
I run in the night, I wait in the light, 
In shadows of darkness, and music I recite.",country

Verse 1
Life's a game of broken rules,
Every move we make requires a fool.
One wrong step is all it takes,
Our choices determine if we win or break.
Chorus
It's the cost of our endless needs,
Idle thoughts and wicked deeds.
What's done is done, no changing fate,
We're just one false move away.
Verse 2
We have a choice to make and it ain't easy,
Our choices come with different fees.
We can choose to win or lose,
Our future's in the hands of me and you.
Chorus
It's the cost of our endless needs,
Idle thoughts and wicked deeds.
What's done is done, no changing fate,
We're just one false move away.
Bridge
At first glance, we're still in this game,
There's a desperate chance that hope may still remain.
Until we come to see the error of our ways,
We're just one false move away.
Chorus
It's the cost of our endless needs,
Idle thoughts and wicked deeds.
What's done is done, no changing fate,
We're just one false move away.
We're just one false move away,
We're just one false move away.",country

Verse 1
I'm takin' a ride in my pick-up truck
Ridin' the back roads in search of some luck
Just tryin' to get away from the day to day
Dreaming of when I could break away

Chorus
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shinin' tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man

Verse 2
I'm sittin' on the tailgate watchin' the stars
Watchin' the world as it passes my car
Thoughts comin' back to me from long ago
Finding my way, just followin' the road

Chorus
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shinin' tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man

Bridge
I'm tryin' to find me a place where I can rest
Somewhere I can go and leave the stress
Away from the hurt and the darkness I see
I'll find me a home and be finally free

Chorus
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shinin' tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man",country

Verse 1:
Riding down the road in my pickup truck
I heard a sound so sweet, a song that just struck
I headed over to the stable and saw the mornin' sun
Beaming down on little Jesus, who'd just begun
Chorus:
How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
Verse 2:
The shepherds in the fields, they heard the news
And soon the wise men had to follow the star's cue
They brought gold, incense, and myrrh to the King
So He'd know He was loved and brought them hope and a dream
Chorus:
How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
Bridge:
I heard the angel's sing and the bells did ring
Telling all the world of His wonderful thing
The Lord of Kings had come down from the sky
And peace on Earth was His great desire

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

Verse 1
Sitting here in darkness all alone,
I can't believe this is how I've been shown,
The way you left me with no goodbye.
Each day I wake, I just start to cry.

Chorus
Let me go, let me go, let me go, woman,
Let me be, set me free from your spell.
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep, woman.
I was cursed from the first day I fell.

Verse 2
You don't want me, but you want me to go on wanting you,
How I pray that you will say that we're through,
Please turn me loose, what's the use,
Let me go, woman, let me go, let me go, let me go.

Bridge
You don't understand how much I've cried,
What I'd do if I could just turn back time.
This broken heart will never mend,
You said it's over, now I'm on my own again.

Chorus
Let me go, let me go, let me go, woman,
Let me be, set me free from your spell.
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep, woman.
I was cursed from the first day I fell.

Verse 3
The pain I feel is hard to face,
No way to turn this hurtful place.
I'm living my life in misery,
This is no way for me to be.

Chorus
Let me go, let me go, let me go, woman,
Let me be, set me free from your spell.
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep, woman.
I was cursed from the first day I fell.

Verse 1
I heard you were comin' around, I know it ain't safe and sound
I been tryin' to stay out of sight, but you've already found me tonight
I don't know what I'm gonna do, with all these feelings inside of me
I can't deny what you do, it's like your holdin' a veto on me

But you could change my mind, little girl if you wanted to
When you look at me the way you do, I'm easy, so damn easy
You look so good and you look so fine, girl you know you could change my mind

Verse 2
We got a long road ahead, and I'm not sure how much it will take
For us to find the right path, and make it out of this heartbreak
I know it's gonna be hard, we just gotta make it through the night
And if you're with me in the morning, I promise to make it alright

Verse 1
My grandfather said, ""Sit down and listen to me
About the place that we come from, it's quite a thing to see
A little city they called Muskogee, a place that'll set you free
Where the spirit of the South runs wild and deep

Chorus
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
No trips on LSD are taken, no draft cards burned in the street
Old Glory still waves down at the courthouse in the small town of Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball

Verse 2
We might not be the hip, wild hippies of San Francisco Bay
No long, shaggy hair or Roman sandals here today
Leather boots still in style, and we love to party and pitch woo
In Muskogee, it's our own way of fun for me and you

Chorus
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
No trips on LSD are taken, no draft cards burned in the street
Old Glory still waves down at the courthouse in the small town of Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball

Verse 3
The college dean still commands respect from the Muskogee kids
Football's the toughest thing on campus with no need for skids
We might be small but our courage is greater and our spirit stands tall
The whole town loves to gather and dance by the local town hall

Chorus
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
No trips on LSD are taken, no draft cards burned in the street
Old Glory still waves down at the courthouse in the small town of Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball",country
