Ride on my pony, ride to the fields,
Watch the sun rise on a summer day.
The sweet smell of the flowers that bloom,
Gives me a feeling that won't go away.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses,
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.

Trot on the river, trot on the lake,
Dance with the wind in an open space.
The stars light the way in the middle of the night,
Giving us light, a magical place.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses, 
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.",country
" 

Passing through that Colorado town, I'm tryin' to make it Oklahoma, 
Just one more stop along the way, then I know I'm gonna make it alright
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as fast as I can.

Rollin' on down the dusty road, my wheels are spinning 'neath the sun,
Smells of coal, smokestack's high, with a load I gotta get done
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

I've been livin' on the road, I got no time for a plan,
The highway's my home and my bed, that's where I'll lay my head 
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

The sky is dark, the stars have come, a bright moon shinin' through,
My wheels keep spinning 'til the night, and I'll be coming home soon
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.",country

Verse 1
A Wednesday morn in the hills of Tennessee 
The wind's a comin' and the cotton's white and clean 
The sun's a shinin', and the birds are singing their song 
And the morning dew can't hide the silence of the dawn 

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Verse 2
A family's home washed away by the raging storm 
A farmer's crop burned up in the heat of the morn 
The road's a river, and the bridge is washed away 
And the echoes of the thunder heard for miles away

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Bridge
The valley's just a whisper, the rolling hills alive 
The farms in tatters and the truth we can't hide 
The songbird's singing of a time we must face 
The judgement of the Lord in a broken land of grace

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day",country

Verse 1
I wake up in the morning, dawning light shone in
With a heavy heart and hurt I can't contain
My arms reach out, searchin' for you in my sleep
But the thunder claps in my soul as I remember you gone

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Verse 2
I head down to the bar, tryin' to drink away my blues
Laughter rings and I shoot some pool with friends, for a moment I'm okay
But when the night closes in and it's just me, oh Lord, I'm overwhelmed
Then I remember that you're not here and deep pain starts to swell

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Bridge
I cry out to the night sky, seeking some kind of sign
But the silence is deafening, your absence is all that I find
And I straighten Miss Emily's picture one last time

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then",country

Verse 1
I was strolling down the street one day,
Thought I'd find some love, nothing to pay,
Saw a girl who looked so fine,
I just couldn't leave her behind.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 2
She said meet me round the corner at half past ten,
Thought my heart would cry, but I went in,
Her room was a place I'd never been,
But something told me I ought to go in.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 3
I thought I'd take her out and buy her a meal,
Naive as a puppy and dammed as a seal,
I thought 'twas true love, but I had it wrong,
I was just another part of her song.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Bridge
Been around the block a few times, now I see the light,
Ain't gonna be fooled again, not by no one tonight,
Gonna find a gal who wants me,
And who knows what real love can be.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.",country

Verse 1 
We left our expectations back on the shoreline 
Took off our worries, left 'em behind 
The sun was settin' low, but the water was so inviting 
We just had to take the risk and take the dive 

Chorus
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions  
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Verse 2 
The night was starry bright, it enveloped us in grace 
The moonlight guided us to a safe place 
No fear of judgement here, 'cause noone could ever see 
We just had to keep believin' and keep our faith 

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions 
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Bridge 
We'll keep on swimmin', in this crystal-clear lake 
We can keep it to ourselves, forever and ever, forever and ever 
And when the waters call us, we'll rise again 
We'll keep on swimmmin', keep our feet on solid ground

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions

Verse 1
I was lost and out of luck,
Searching all the backroads for love
Breaking all the rules, that I made up
Leaving only dust and broken dreams

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Verse 2
Thought I’d never find someone like you
Every stoplight and bar had something to do
Running around, losing again and again
But now I know it was all for a reason

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Bridge
You showed up just in time and knocked on my door
Brought with you sweet sunshine and love evermore
No more searching for love in all the wrong places
God bless the day I discovered you lookin’ for love

Chorus
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about
Now that I’ve found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered you, oh you lookin’ for love",country

Verse 1
The mountain seems so high, with obstacles in my way
I'm struggling to stay strong, so I can make it through the day
I'm reminded of His grace, and of His constant love
He's been here from the start, and will be with me from above

Chorus 
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Verse 2
No matter where I turn, whatever I'm going through
I'm reminded of His Word, and of the hope He gives anew
He'll never forsake me, no matter how I stray
The Lord remains by side, no matter what the cost may be

Chorus
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Bridge
And I will always trust, His promise is sure
His faithfulness will never pass, He's a light that will endure
His mercy never fails, He's by my side when I fall
I know that God is always here, and He'll never leave me at all

Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 2:
Belshazzar's heart was filled with fear
The writing said time was running out
But Daniel held his hand and said,
""Your kingdom shall soon be overthrown""

The writing said his rule had come to an end
The king's fate lay in Daniel's hands
He must surrender the throne to Darius
And to the Lord he must make amends


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 3:
The warning had been given loud and clear
And Belshazzar heeded the call
To avoid the wrath of the Lord
He must give up his throne to all

But Belshazzar's pride and his ignorance lingered still
And he refused to give up his reign
Vengeance was swift and it came with a roar
His kingdom fell and would never be the same


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Outro:
Belshazzar's demise was a lesson for all
Pride goes before a fall
His arrogance was his own downfall
He should've learned to heed the warnings of old",country

Verse 1
It started with a smile, a twinkle in your eye
The way you said my name and how you made me feel alive
But when I was young and naive, I didn't see the signs
And now I'm left to wonder when the truth will be mine

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 2
The lies and secrets that you kept, I still feel betrayed
You took my trust and cast it aside, like it was some kind of game
Was all just part of your plan, lead me on while you can
You might have thought I would fall down, but I'm still rolling on

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 3
You thought you had me fooled, but I'm wiser than you think
Took me for a fool, but still I rise above you
You might have thought I'd give up, but I'm staying strong
I won't let go, this fight is not about to end

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Bridge 
You can't ignore the truth, no matter how hard you try
It's a part of me, and it's here to stay
There's no need to keep trying to turn back the time
I'm moving forward, no more games to play

Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong

Verse 1
I am a young woman livin' in small town Tennessee
My old man works hard all day, just to keep us fed
If wishes were horses and dreams were made of steel
I'd drive this rutted road away to something better than I feel

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 2
They say living's easy now, compared to times before
But all that changes when I'm down here on the floor
I don't want no silver spoon, or a mansion on a hill
I just want a steady job, and someone who'll love me still

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 3
They say there's a brighter day, down a long and winding road
But I can't seem to get there, like I'm stuck in heavy snow
I don't want no fortune, or a bigger pile of gold
Just one thing to keep me going, so I can stay on this road

Make me an angel, who flies from town to town

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares 
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Driving in the night, heading for the light
Feeling free like I'm in flight
Gonna make it through, not gonna be like you
Ain't gonna be your fool no more

Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
Gonna lose your shirt when you dive
Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
I'm the king of the hive

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, like I'm in sin
Blow away all of your cares
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Can't control no more, can't take it like before

Say goodbye to this train, gonna start living again
No I won't be your fool no more

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares

Is hard for us all when we can't hold our own
They talked about us livin' in despair

Verse 1 
Drivin' down the highway, starin' out the window,
Livin' on the lost side of town, feelin' so far away from home.
My heart is runnin' faster, I can't keep still,
I won't admit defeat, tryin' to regain control on this endless wheel.

I can find myself a woman, but no ring could ever be heavy enough,

Rustlin' in the wind, I've been through my darkest days,
The sun can't penetrate the cloud that's been hangin' over me since yesterday.

All hope feelin' so distant as I gave up my fight.

I woke up this mornin' to a dawn so bright,
Heard a bird singin' in the apple tree.
Listenin' to the whisperin' of the wind,
Singin' 'bout a life I once used to live.

Lost my way, just tryin' to find a place to go.
I was lost in my mind, not sure which way to go.
Life can take you down a path so dark,
Still tryin' to find some hope in the dark.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

Hope is hard to find when faith is hard to keep.
And love is hard to find when nobody believes.
Sometimes life can be so cruel, and hard to take,
Still tryin' to find that light to break.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on livin' my life,
Searchin' around for that silver light.
The only way to find my hope and way,
Is to keep prayin' that someday I'll be OK.

Verse 1:
If you see her out tonight, she'll act so strong and standing tall
But in the depths of her heart lies a vulnerability that she'll keep hidden away
She's been broken before, and so now it's hidden behind the wall
And she'll tell you she's alright and she won't need a man tonight, that's what she says

Chorus:
But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets
And not too long ago she swore she'd never let her heart be broken anymore

Verse 2:
Living on a fragile edge, she's trying to stay away from the heartache
But a little bit of love could make her feel alive
Holding on despite the pain, in silent hopes of a brighter tomorrow
But no one knows that she's been longing for a little tenderness

But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets

Red and orange sparks dancing across the pond tonight

Baby we're getting out of here, I could care less where it leads us
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight

Let's head on down this lonesome road, no need for second thoughts
Two hearts living for the moment, ain't no room for nothin else

Verse 1

I've seen a ghost of a faded moonbeam,
As it moved across my windowpane,
Tossing and turning in the chilly night air,
The rain as it was washing away my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 2

Looking at the tracks of the careless windbeam,
Or moving to the tracks of the tireless freight train,
Lit up the sides of the weathervane,
As the bits of rain and the windowpane,
Took away my hopes and my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 3

I've looked for the moonbeam, as it flew away,
Taken away by the summer breeze,
But the ghost of my dreams still lingers on,
As I search for the light of the moonbeam.

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,

I've been wandering on a road so long, 
Open skies my only home, 
But I've never felt so lost and so alone, 
Until I found a new way to roam.

Ain't know how to take back control, 
I heard a voice it made me change, 
I ain't ashamed to let you know.

When the struggle is so hard,
Follow the dreams, keep searchin for the truth,
The answers waiting for you in your heart.

So many trials, all along the way, 
Battles coming from all sides, 
Willie's voice, gives me strength to stay, 
Like a miracle he saw me through the night.

And I know what would Willie do, 
If he was here for me now,
He'd smile so strong and take me by the hand, 
And show me a better way somehow.

Snappy new jeans and her boots all tight

Got no reason to care what anyone's thinkin'

The sun sets in the west, and I see the spark in your eyes
As you turn around and whisper, we found a special kind of love

Begging you to come back, make it right
Take my hand and I'll never let go, sweet Ophelia

Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Ah, out here in the country, ain't nobody pushing us
Time heals all wounds, if you just let it do its thing
So don't let your heart be shoved, but just let it wander free
Take a breath and relax, don't let nobody rush thee

Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Nothing can keep us apart, when the journey's oh so long

Verse 1 
It's been quite a while since I last saw your face 
I replay all the moments, can't find my place 
I never really knew when it all went wrong 
It's too late to reverse, it won't be long 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head 
Way back when the world was young 
Long before this song was sung 
I know someone must have hurt like me 

Verse 2 
Tried my best to please you, you took my love for granted 
Cried my eyes out for you, but you never changed it 
I don't regret the day I laid my eyes on you 
But I regret the way I lost my point of view 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head

Bridge 
No one can tell me why I keep hanging on 
Can't unlock the feelings I can't seem to move on

At where I lost the thread

My life has been a broken round, 
Full of trials and no peace to be found. 
Never understood the why or the how, 
But I’d search for an answer right now.

A rose for affection and a thorn for my heart, 
Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start. 
I run in the night, I wait in the light, 
In shadows of darkness, and music I recite.

A letter by the door, I thought that it was more, 
Cashmere for the weather and wool for the cold. 
A bed made of feathers, my mask made of lies, 
My broken soul drowning in a sea of goodbye.

Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start.

Every move we make requires a fool.
One wrong step is all it takes,

As I take this road to find a better place
The memories of her still linger in my veins
I want to find a way to make things right again
But I'm searching for a way back to Harlan County Line

I see her face in my dreams and I know it's true
That I never should have left that place without you
One thousand miles and I'm still trying to forget
Cause I can't go back to the Harlan County Line

I hear the wind whistling through the trees
The rivers flowing and the birds singing in the breeze
The coal dust in the air fills my memory
Of that sweet little girl I used to know back in Harlan County Line

The cattle down in the valley are mooing in the night
The riverbanks are still singing in the moonlight
My heart is full of longing and I can't deny
That I'm wanting to find my way back to the Harlan County Line

The sun is setting in the West and the stars are startin to shine
I'm thinking back to all the places I've been and all the love I left behind
I still remember all the kindness they showed me there
But I can't go back to the Harlan County Line

No matter where I go, it's here that I want to stay
I'm just searchin for a way to find my peace of mind

Gave up my home in London England
Hungry for warmer sunsets
So I hopped a plane and made my way
To Lincoln Nebraska instead
Crossed the Atlantic and the States
Could hardly believe the view
Left New York and drove all night
Missouri said “hello” to me

The city offers me a steady place
A new home with new roads
Can’t help but feel a little overwhelmed

A promise of a place to call my own
A new journey has begun
That I can call my own

Georgia was my last kiss goodbye
Ran through the night, steam all around me
To see what this Midwest life would bring
Louisville, Indianapolis, flew like the blink of an eye
And before I knew it, Nebraska was in sight

My motor's runnin' on empty, out on this lonesome road
I'm lookin' for a place, and somewhere to call my home
I drove into this bar, and stepped up onto the stool
The bartender said, ""What'll it be, now, son?""

And I said,

""I'm just lookin' for a little solace, some sweet relief
A beer will do just fine, to help me ease my grief
The place was filled with a mighty crowd, and I'm all by myself
But I shook it off, and this is what I said""

""Hello, lonesome stranger, livin' life on the run
Sure hope you find your fill, and someplace you can call home
I've seen the darkness and the light, and I know it can be done
So don't you give up now, my lonesome stranger, son""

The years they rolled on by, I finally found my way
To a house and some friends, and now I'm here to stay
But I'm still on the road, when I'm searchin' for the truth
Until I find my heart, I'll keep rolling on my boots

""So long, lonesome stranger, livin' life on the run
You never gave up hope, so now you can call this home
The past was rough, it's true, but you kept on goin' strong
You kept pressin' on, goodbye, my lonesome stranger, son""",country

Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends
Tell 'em I'm still rollin' but I ain't going round in circles

Lost in my lonesome county and it's hard to bear
Pain and sorrow linger on, and I'm still standing there
Fate's hand holds tight on my every move
But I'm not afraid of life no matter what it throws at me

Hey mama when you leave, don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothing, I can't use nothing
Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends

Bridge:
My fate is sealed and my spirit never lies
These are the precious things, and the only words worth remembering
You take what you get, and you smile through the pain
Cause being born is going blind, and bowing down a thousand times

Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends

Lookin' out at the Savannah from my front porch light
Barely a whisper of wind on this cool summer night
My heart feels so hollow, I'm so empty inside
Just hopin' for that special one to come and fill my life

Blue moon, ain't nobody ever been so sad and so alone

" it s seen a lot of tan legs got a kick ass radio heard alot of singing along with some country songs and rock and roll got a 38 bullet hole courtesy of kate tillman s dad alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs he said if i don t come back you can have this ford just tape a picture of me on the dashboard 

He drove away in a cloud of dust as I waved goodbye
I watched as his truck disappeared on that summer night
I knew that if he didn't make it back his old truck was mine 
And I just had to keep the dashboard in its time

It's seen a lot of pickups and flags, of honor and pride
Heard a lot of stories, of laughter and tears in the night
And I'd see the bullet hole from Kate Tillman's dad 
It's been witness to a lot of memories that I'm glad I had 

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford
With the stories it told, it's a memory I'll always hold
For his sacrifice I'll keep it safe and sound
With his picture on the dashboard, that truck won't let me down

I pulled it out of the garage and the smell brought him back
The wear and tear of a veteran truck, in my heart it did attack
Still got a kick ass radio and a dive bar view
I thought of my brother and all the days we had, and what he went through

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford
With the stories it told, it's a memory I'll always hold
For his sacrifice I'll keep it safe and sound
With his picture on the dashboard, that truck won't let me down

When I'm out on the open road with that truck, it takes me back
To the times when we'd laugh and joke, never worry about attack
As I cruise down that highway, the stories still live on
On the dashboard of his old ford, I think of him and I'm gone 

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford

She's standing in the country night,
In the lights of the distant fair,
The emotion ringing in her eyes so clear,
It's more than I can bear.
Torn between what I'm feeling and what I should do,
Cause I'm stuck in a world that's so right,
And I can't keep it inside, these thoughts of loving her that won't subside.

So keep on walking on little girl,
Cause it's only you that's missing.
Oh my lord, she walks on by,
She wonders what is wrong with me,
And I left a world in her little hands,
But it's not her fault for the way that she fell.

The pain that I see in her eyes,
She's lost out on love again,
I try to catch her but I can't compete,
In this game I just can't win.
And I'm standing in the shadows as I watch her go,
But I know that I'd talk to her if only I could show,
That my love's been here all along,
But it's just not that strong.

And the girl of my dreams was just a distant song.
You asked me how I could be feeling so low, 
But you'd feel the same if your heart had been broken in two.

So play me a Hank song to ease my pain, 
It helps to know that someone felt the same.

My Stetson shadows my eyes, but I'm not afraid
To show the world that underneath I just craved a different way

Out here, life's a wild ride and the fate of man hangs by a thread
The lawmen chased me to the edge, but of mercy they had to be fed

And the federales said they could have had me, but out of kindness I had to hide

Day after day, desperados took their toll
And their days of doin' wrong, they just had to go

An ice cold beer and a tune to fix

Traveling all night, just to find a change,
Searching for the one who stole my heart,
She's the one I've been longing for from the start.

Long days under the sun, while the moon's up to stay,

Leavin' behind all my worries as I go
Needin' to find something I can call my own

There's a starry night here in Tennessee,
Lights are shakin' up in the distance my heart can see,
I've been makin' my way, tryin' to move on up,
No matter what life sends my way I won't give up.

So I'm gonna roll out on this country road,
Take a chance, won't let this path go untold,
I'm gonna spread my wings and reach for the stars,
Catch a dream and move on past the bar.

Guitar pickin' and a twang of steel,
Soulful words of pain and love I feel,
Lyrics of this life that I have to live on,
Makin' music for the pleasure it brings me and those who come along.

I'm gonna roll out and make this journey last,
Takin' chances and takin' what's meant to pass,
Gonna leave the doubters in my rear view mirror,
Ain't nobody gonna get in the way of what I'm meant to be.

I'm gonna roll out, a runaway train,
I'm gonna do what's right, ain't gonna cause no strain,
I'm gonna travel this road and leave nothin' behind,
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, I'm gonna make my destiny mine.

I'm gonna roll out, a runaway train,
Lookin' forward, no more lookin' back again,
Keepin' both feet on the ground, won't ever look back,
Gonna go on livin', I'm gonna make my dreams come true, and that's a fact.",country

Verse 1
He was a trucker down in Alabama, tryin' to make some cash
He drove on through the night, haulin' moonshine, corn whiskey and hash
On the back roads of Tennessee, an undercover cop was there
He got him and booked him, never thought he'd escape a life of despair

Chorus
And the walls came tumblin' down
Never saw 'em when they stood, never saw 'em when they fell
And the walls came tumblin' down
In the land of the free, where trouble still dwells

Verse 2
He was an outlaw in Arkansas, he'd broken just about every law
He owned a stake of land, but still worked as far away as he saw
When the law came searchin' for him, he hid in the mountains of Maine
Trying to dodge the bounty hunters was a game of hide and seek

Chorus
And the walls came tumblin' down
Never saw 'em when they stood, never saw 'em when they fell

In the land of the free, where trouble still dwells

Verse 3
He was a jailbird in Kansas, found guilty of grand theft auto
He'd do anything to make a buck, he'd rob a bank or swindle a soul
The law was never far behind him, no matter what disguise he wore
He didn't care about the consequences, from Texas to the shores

Livin' down in Tennessee, we heard a sad tale of woe
About a man and a woman livin' down by the river low
They try to make a livin', whatever way they can
Selling cases of whiskey, and the finest smoke in the land

Chorus

And the walls came down all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standin'

Verse 2

They loaded up the Caddy with a load of corn whiskey 
They took to the back roads, out runnin' from the law
Though they tried to be careful, they could never seem to last
Caught by the sheriff, with a bag of contraband

Chorus

And the walls came down all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standin'

Verse 3

The sheriff took them back to town, the judge had no mercy
Sentencing them to five years, like the devil himself had cursed em'
They always said, they'd make it out one day
Though angels would have to come and carry 'em away

But one faithful night, the guard seemed to look the other way
The couple snuck out, one last time to make it far away
With the sunrise, the news spread like wildfire
Their freedom is a symbol of heart, freedom and desire

Verse 1 
I've been here before all these broken roads, 
With the heartache and the hurt and the pain it holds. 
I've been up, I've been down and I can see clear, 
I'm ready to try a different way this year. 

Chorus 
So I'm giving in without you it's too rough, 
I'm standing here again and I'm had enough. 
I've finally realise it's love that never dies, 
And I'm really not that tough, no I'm really not that tough. 

Verse 2 
I can't go back to where I came, 
I'm learning how to let my heart break the chains. 
So I'm here again and I'm not scared, 
Cause I don't want to miss the joy love can share. 

Chorus 
So I'm giving in without you it's too rough, 
I'm standing here again and I'm had enough. 
I've finally realise it's love that never dies, 
And I'm really not that tough, no I'm really not that tough. 

Bridge 
The past is gone and I'm moving on, 
And I'm gonna find a new way home. 
Cause no one can take away the love we make, 
It will be written on my heart when I'm gone.

So I'm giving in without you it's too rough,

But love is something I don't understand
The miles I traveled kept me away too long
My heart has been broken and I just don't belong

The road I'm travellin' is so hard and long
But thoughts of you make my love so strong
My dreams of us never quite seem to come true
If I'm ever gonna find my way I'll need a little bit of you

Verse 1:
Just a small town boy, trying to make it on my own, 
I had no one there to lend me a hand and guide me home
But I had a dream, and a hollerin' to do, 
So I hopped on a train bound for anywhere but here

Chorus:
Oh, they don't know my name, but that's okay
They didn't know my story, yet they still showed me the way
And I know nothing can stop me, I'm destined for the stars
Just know that I'm thankful, for all the love I've known

Verse 2:
Heading out on this highway, stars above my head
Getting closer to the place I want to be
But I don't want to get too far, that old life was part of me
And I'm sure I'll hear them hollerin' in the wind one day

Chorus:
Oh, they don't know my name, but that's okay
They didn't know my story, yet they still showed me the way

It's been five years since I left, but I'm finally on my way

I take them out from time to time, reminiscing what we once had
I think of all the stories that my folks told me, something I'll never lack
I guess it's written in my genes, these guns become apart of me
They've been there for the rides up north, for the Texas to the Utah scene

Chorus 1:
I got the guns that were passed down the line
From my nana and papa, but now they're mine
They've been to Utah and all the way back,
Colorado, Wyoming and the Grand Canyon too
On hunting trips in the freezing snow, always up before the sun
These old guns are apart of me, I got the guns

Verse 2:
I never had the chance to meet him, much too young to see his face
He passed away on the Corpus Christi Bay, when I was just a babe
A Christian man, my grandfather, he ran the nursery near the church
Amazin' Grace, I can still hear him singing, somethin' I'll never search

Chorus 2:
I've seen the tears in grown men's eyes when they speak of their grandpa
And laugh about how he spoiled them all, a tradition he will pass on
No memories of my own, of our time that we shared
So I keep hanging onto his old guns

Bridge:
Nana was here for Christmas of '79, the only daughter's son
My sister's innocent wish of that year, dear Lord bring Nana back to us
Instead she got her earrings, old-time clip-ons and a smile that would never fade
At eight years old, I got the guns, a part of me that will never change

Chorus 3:
A 16-gauge and my grandmother's 410, a 270 that my dad fired once
He brought a mule deer in and that's where I found it
I keep these guns to remind me of him, of his faith and all his love
No matter what life brings, his strength is still around me when I hold his guns",country

Searchin' for solace from this life I've acquired.

Way down south of Hudson Bay,
The warmth of that same love that I'd found,
Had no choice but to go away.

On my mission to the girl in Saskatoon,
I'm freezing but I'm burning in my heart,
Gonna go and find the one I love.

Heading south and west, beneath the cold December sun,
I slept in the carragana when my journey was done,
And in the early morning light, we'd both press onward 'till noon,
Anxious to reunite with the girl in Saskatoon.

On my mission to the girl in Saskatoon,

The prairie lilies grew in abundance on my way,
The church steeple loomed against the prairie moon,
To find my true love, the girl in Saskatoon.

Today could be the day where I finally settle down

Where I'm from,
The Lord's blessed us with all of His grace
Where I'm from,
We're always striving to make it a better place

School Days are memories,
Now its time to find my way
Had my heart broke a few times,
But we still feel the same

You'd be surprised what you learn,
When your feet stay in the same place.
Living life day by day,
That's just the way it goes,

Where I'm from,
The Lord's blessed us with all of His grace
Where I'm from,
We're always striving to make it a better place.

We've all made mistakes,
But we've all grown from them too
The bond of family,
Is something that's never been broken

We're all trying to make a livin,
With our heads held up high
Our Southern drawl is something that'll never die

Where I'm from,
The Lord's blessed us with all of His grace
Where I'm from,
We're always striving to make it a better place.",country

I used to be so scared of love before you,
Livin' life on my own, so hard to endure.
I thought that love would all just end in heartache, 
Don't have to be scared of it now, all thanks to you.

Gone are all my doubts, I'm finally free.

Your love has opened up my eyes, I don't have to think twice.

But you showed me the truth, that love could never change.
I thought that I'd never find someone to stay, 
But you cherished me, showed me a new way.

Gone are all my doubts, I'm finally free.

The sun was risin high in the Texas sky when I drove my pickup truck out of town
Livin on my own, searchin for a home and a place to lay my weary head down
I spotted an old roadside motel, I needed a bed so I turned off the road
I heard a sweet voice singing in the wind, and I knew I'd never be alone

Singin' yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee

Well I turned off the motor and I rolled down the windows and I listened to her sweet refrain
I had no idea where I was goin', it didn't matter as long as I'd get there someday
She sang of a good ole boy who loved his whiskey and never would give an ounce of pain
And for that on the road that night I knew I'd never be the same

Singin' yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee

Well, the years have come and gone, livin' life from town to town
Searchin' for a peace I’d found in that song, but my faith and time had run out
I never found that boy, and I still don't know why, but I'm thankful for his melody
I guess he just wanted to remind us what's worth livin’ and dyin’ for truly

My ol truck is headed down the dusty highway
With the windows wide open and the radio playin'
My heart is filled with longing for what I used to know
Trying to find the courage to let it all go

Headin for Texas, my home away from home
Singing a song of freedom as I'm driftin' along
Longin' for the life that I used to lead
Where I can feel the sunshine and breathe the open air

Chorus:
Freedom's just another word for sweet memories of my past
And no matter how far I roam, those days will always last

Me and Bobby McGee will find the sun again

I'm getting closer to the border, but I'm feeling so alone
My heart is aching, but I'm still standing strong
I'm lookin' for a sweet escape, to find my peace of mind
Where I can leave behind the heartache and find love one more time

Through the tears and sorrow, I'm finding my way
Holdin on to hope that I'll find brighter days
I'm reachin' for the future and learning how to fly
No one can take away my freedom cause it's mine

Can't wait to start over and put the darkness behind
I'm gonna spread my wings and find a brand new day
I'm gonna leave the darkness and find love on the way

Ain't it funny how the times fly by,
I was living it up in '89,
My truck was my home, I had no place to stay,
But I kept the faith and kept on headed my way.

I'm on the road and things keep a changing,
Gettin close to the edge and faith keeps sustaining,
A voice in my heart told me this ain't right,
Gonna hit the gas and leave all this behind.

Chorus:
Take the money and run,
Get away before it all comes undone,
Believe me, in this life you got to move it on,
Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun,
Don't be a fool, trust no one,
You got to take the money and run.

My heart was breakin' but I had to be strong,
The wind it was blowin' but I kept on going on,
There was no use in looking back,
Just keep following my dream, nothing I can't lack.

Though the night be dark and the rain may come,
My faith kept me strong, I kept on going on,
No one else can carry me through,
My dreams will be true, I can make them come true.

So if you find yourself lost in time,
Like I was back in ninety-nine,
You gotta do what you gotta do,
To get away and keep on movin' through.

Sitting in the farmhouse on an old wooden chair,
Ain't much to do but sip my sweet iced tea,
Thinking of the things I wanted and the things I left behind,
And a lesson that I learned from all that time

Take the money and run, Get it at the point of a gun,
Believe it in this town, You can't trust anyone,
You're gonna learn that lesson my son,
Take the money and run, Buy yourself a place in the sun.

I had to thank my Heavenly Father for this second chance,
To start a-over and to give myself a chance,
My bags were packed and my heart was light,
I was headed out of town, and into the night

Take the money and run, Get it at the point of a gun,
Believe it in this town, You can't trust anyone,
You're gonna learn that lesson my son,
Take the money and run, Buy yourself a place in the sun.

The sun never sets in this country sky,
A place I'm proud to call mine,
The gentle summer wind was calling me,
To take the money and run to my happiness and peace of mind.

Take the money and run, Get it at the point of a gun,
Believe it in this town, You can't trust anyone,
You're gonna learn that lesson my son,
Take the money and run, Buy yourself a place in the sun.",country

She had a light heart and a lonesome mess
She held a banjo out of sight
And when she sang it sounded so right
But when she gazed into my eyes

My mama told me stories 'bout far away places
The times she been and how she'd like to go back again
She'd dream of one day being free to fly
But with her family at home it just wasn't the same

I do as I dare, let 'em call me insane
Never sitting on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance with all that I have

Mama used to tell me how her dreams went astray
Telling me how much she wanted to break away
How there was a time when she thought of leaving it all behind
But she chose to put down roots and stay by her side

Desperately he looks for a way out of this nightmare

Them northside angels, they're the sweetest thing you'll ever see
Here comes a lady and there she goes, everybody knows where the wild wind blows
I put a Mississippi pickle in your Brooklyn buns, for free

Beer can stumblin' in the wind, down metropolitan

Woke up this morning with a guitar in my hand,
Strummed the strings and started playin' a band,
Must have been the stars shinin' from above, 
Open up my heart with a song of love, 

Do you feel like I do? 
Do you feel like I do, my friend? 

Had a little party and a shindig on the farm, 
We all gathered 'round just to hear the band, 
The jukebox was dancin' and the fiddles playin', 
Old and young folks all joyfully raisin', 

Do you feel like I do? 
Do you feel like I do, my friend? 

Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no river wide, 
Ain't no two-step that we couldn't ride, 
The campfire was smokin' and the moonshine flowin', 
Stars above, I just got to knowin', 

Do you feel like I do? 
Do you feel like I do, my friend?",country

Verse 1:
We could take a drive up to the mountains,
Kick up some dust in the red dirt air,
Maybe see if we can find a little spot that only we know,
Where we can be alone and free and wild.

So you're saying there's a chance,
Out here beneath the stars,
For two hearts to dance,
And a one in a million shot of finding true romance.

We could jump in the river and do some dancin'
Boot stompin' and clapping our hands,
Staying up late in the summertime,
We'll never look back on these golden days.

Where the farm hands have been toiling all day
Buffalo roams, corn on the cob at their heels
A sight that brings peace to my soul I can say

The sun sets in a blaze of fiery hues
The West Texas sky painted in pastel blues
Crickets are singing and the air smells of hay
Down here in this world of wonders just like today

Soft whispers of wind, like a lullaby
My heart aches with longing, so I just sigh
A glimpse of the stars, shooting by in the night
Take away all my pain, giving me new sight

The night's alive with the howling of coyotes
Serenading each other, their voices in joy
I feel life in my veins, as I raise up my head
To this world of wonders, where I'm filled with dread

The morning brings with it a whole new light
The birds and the bees, the sun shining bright
A feeling of home, of a place that's mine

Like I'm lost in a world of wonders, a world of wonders, a world of wonders

There's a fire in her eyes that still sets my heart aflame

He was the king of the rodeo, a cowboy through and through

The way he moved, the way he spoke, made every heart beat just a little bit faster
The pride and joy of every local town, he always stood tall and proud

He'd pull his hat down low and ride, telling stories of old

He's a honky tonky heavily funky ex-marine. 
He wears the skin tight body builder shirts 
And Jack, he'll knock you out into the dirt. 
But if you don't got no money or you try to get funny, 
Then brother, you're gonna see that man's gonna do the Boogie Woogie and the Hoochie Coochie 
And he'll be doin' all his dancin' on you. 

Chorus 
So if you're lookin' for a good time, 
Look hard as you want, 
But you ain't gonna find any kind of bad times 
You'll find every Friday and Saturday evening 
At the Top Hat Bar and Grill. 

Lookin' for a good time, lookin' for a bad time, 
So if you're lookin' for a good time,

There's a place outside the city, just beyond the county line
Where a quaint little bar sits, and it's known for its good time
You can stroll in any evening, on a Friday or a Saturday
And know that you'll find some fun, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

At the Top Hat Bar and Grill, the music's always loud
Ain't no better body shakin' joint, nowhere to be found
The locals come in droves, they know they'll always get their fill
Of good drinks and good company, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

There's a waitress, she goes by Lil, divorcee, but she ain't no shy lass
Known for her tight hip huggin' pants, and her dancin' class
She can do the boogie woogie, the hoochie and the boogaloo
She'll have you movin' an' groovin' quick, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

And there's a bouncer Gil, he's an ex-marine, he don't mess around
His tight bodysuits, a sight to see, for miles around
He'll keep things peaceful and lively, no matter what happens
And you'll have a good time, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

If you're lookin' for a good time, look hard as you want
You won't find no better time, spot for your hometown
Every Friday and Saturday night, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
You'll have a mighty fine time, have yourself a real thrill",country

I left my hometown in my pickup truck just to get away
Headin' out to the old west side, to an unknown place
Just when I was 'bout to give up, I heard a distant sound
It was the beat of a cowboy's heart, and the melody of the rodeo
So you better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
The cowboy is comin' to town
He's been herding his cattle all day and night
Gonna find out who's been doin' it right
The cowboy is comin' to town
You can hear the yee haw and see the dust swirl
All sorts of stockings ready to unfurl
The cowboy is comin' to town
You can hear the cowboys singing and feel the campfire heat
Telling stories of trails they've been on, they just can't seem to repeat
You'd better stay on the right side of the law, be kind and be brave
'Cause the cowboy will find out if you've been naughty or nice, you better be sure to behave
So you better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
The cowboy is comin' to town
He's been herding his cattle all day and night
Gonna find out who's been doin' it right
The cowboy is comin' to town
There'll be Texas two-step and a line dance too
Folks celebrating the good life in their boots
The cowboy is comin' to town
Headin' on down to the saloon, welcoming crowds of all kinds
To eat, drink, and be merry, these folks just couldn't be denied
So you better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Verse 1:
I just drove my truck out on the old highway road
With the engine spinnin' like a singing lark in the sky
Headin' for my hometown where I was born and raised
Just to get some peace of mind and some solace by my side

Chorus:
So put on your boots and grab your hat
There's something that I need to know
We're gonna have a time, we're gonna have a jamboree
Cuz Santa Claus is comin' to town

Verse 2:
He's makin' a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's been naughty and who's been nice
Everyone's goin' crazy, you can feel the rhythm and the beat
It's gonna be a fun night for us to move our feet

Chorus:
So get in the mood, put on a show
We're gonna have a Christmas party of our own
We're gonna strum our guitar and yodel down the street
Cuz Santa Claus is comin' to town

Verse 3:
We got 'em Christmas bells and jingle drums
A hot cup of cocoa, with plenty of ice and rum
We'll be dancin' the night away 'til the morning light fades
Then we'll say goodbye to Santa as he disappears in the dawn

Verse 1 
I'm stuck here in this broken cycle, it's hard to feel inspired
My feet don't seem to touch the ground, I'm standing on too much wire
Heartache leads me to you still, always wondering why
It's a treacherous path I'm on, just trying to stay alive

Chorus 
It's a fine line between love and madness, suspense and fear
Sometimes I just can't take it no more, why won't you come near?
Baby its a fine line, don't you hear it knocking on the door?
Why must we keep going round and round, will it ever be more? 

Verse 2
My soul is yearning for something new, a vibrant life to grab
I'm far too much in my own mind, it seems to be a habit
I want something more, something real, a piece of the sky
But alas I'm stuck in this rut, I'm silently asking why

Riding his horse from sun 'till three,
Folks said he was a man of means,

Verse 1 
Her boots are well worn, her hat is tipped low 
She hops on the saddle and holds on real tight 
She knows every move, every kick and every blow 
She's a saddle bronc girl and she's gonna ride all night

Chorus 
She's a saddle bronc girl, she's one of a kind 
She drives a beat up Chevy, hedge pack and it moves her down the line
Big bronc wind in town just up ahead 
Better hold on tight and tap up just right 
Saddle bronc girl if the glory is in the going 
When she might as well get gone, oh she got no way of knowing 
What kinda bronc she's drawn on the rodeo road she chose 
The warriors way, oh hold on tight and tap up just right 
Saddle bronc girl

Verse 2 
She don't mind the pain, she don't mind the dust 
She won't stop 'til the buzzer says give it up 
This girl she's the queen of the rodeo rust 
She's a saddle bronc girl and she's never seen enough

Chorus 
She's a saddle bronc girl, she's one of a kind 
She drives a beat up Chevy, hedge pack and it moves her down the line
Big bronc wind in town just up ahead

Saddle bronc girl if the glory is in the going 
When she might as well get gone, oh she got no way of knowing 
What kinda bronc she's drawn on the rodeo road she chose 
The warriors way, oh hold on tight and tap up just right 
Saddle bronc girl

Verse 3 
She hears the crowd cheer and the rodeo songs 
She knows if she makes it, she'll ride along 
She never stops till her time is done 
She's a saddle bronc girl and her spirit will never come undone 

Chorus 
She's a saddle bronc girl, she's one of a kind

Saddle bronc girl, wild and free
Nothing can slow her down and nothing will hold her back
Don't need no one, she's an outlaw at heart
She's a saddle bronc girl, that'll never change

Verse 2
She's a good ole country girl, with a few wrongs to right
A heart of fire, and a spirit just like the moonlight
She don't take no lip, and she'll never back down
And she'll fight 'til it's her way, and never give up the crown

Her strength and courage will never be denied

Always stay the same never thought I'd give in

Counting all the memories, of the moments we've shared, love
I'm still feelin' your kiss, and the warmth of your touch
I never thought I'd miss you, so much

Chorus
Nights in blue, never reaching the end

Verse 1
It's like you think you know me, but you don't really know me
One day, you'll wake up and figure that out
When that day comes, I'm thinkin' you'll be leavin' now
I don't know how long my forever's gonna be
But I invite you to come and spend mine with me
And I'ma do my best to make sure we live happily
And you just keep what's left when something happens to me

Chorus
I'm lookin' for someone to marry me
Take care of me, and bury me
These days, that's a rarity
But I can guarantee
If I broadcast live from deep within me
God'll send me someone, only divinity could ever get the credit for
And I can take her from the hood to the Gucci store
God gave her a O.G. for a daddy, bad broad for a mama
From tank tops and thongs to them Prada pajamas
And I'ma be awake when I'm supposed to be asleep
Cause my mind's on my money, and I'm knowin' I'ma reap what I sow, I'm a beast

Verse 2
Who should be heavily medicated, huh?
That's their opinion to me, I'm just dedicated
Motivated by thoughts of empty mouths, nightmares of comin' home to an empty house
I know what it is to seek somethin' and fail titanicly
Built a castle and watched it collapse in front of me
My daughter, she survived the tragedy, the aftermath of my attempt at a family

Chorus
So don't sit there and talk about what I already know
Or sit there and act as though you would never go
Like you would never ever pack your bags and leave
I'm not comparin' you to her, it's just a reaction to me
People take all they can take, and I just run 'em away
Even I can't believe some of the stuff that I say
The holes in the walls can easily be fixed with mud
The holes in us can only be repaired with love
And they can only be mended, they can never be fixed
'Cause people forgive you, but they can never forget

Bridge
I'm hard to love, some say I'm hard to like
But I've been through a lot of things and I'm scarred for life

Now if you've never been in love, it's irrelevant to you
If you ever prayed for me, then I'ma pray for you too
Baby girl, I'm tryin' see all of your dreams come true
So try to understand how my size fourteens feel
I need another female like a hole in the head
If I ever caught you cheatin', it'd be holes in the bed
Holes in the head of a man caught up in the middle of a good thing gone bad
I ain't sorry for the mm mm
I could never envision you betrayin' me
The one you don't suspect, that's the one it's gon' be
No trust other than my trust in God, 'cause everyone I ever trusted has broke my heart

Chorus
I keep my guard up, and it could never be lowered
And you could never sucker punch me, I'm forever lookin' for it
You go through the bad just to get to the good
Somethin' I wish more people understood
