Ride on my pony, ride to the fields,
Watch the sun rise on a summer day.
The sweet smell of the flowers that bloom,
Gives me a feeling that won't go away.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses,
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.

Trot on the river, trot on the lake,
Dance with the wind in an open space.
The stars light the way in the middle of the night,
Giving us light, a magical place.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses, 
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.",country
" 

Passing through that Colorado town, I'm tryin' to make it Oklahoma, 
Just one more stop along the way, then I know I'm gonna make it alright
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as fast as I can.

Rollin' on down the dusty road, my wheels are spinning 'neath the sun,
Smells of coal, smokestack's high, with a load I gotta get done
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

I've been livin' on the road, I got no time for a plan,
The highway's my home and my bed, that's where I'll lay my head 
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

The sky is dark, the stars have come, a bright moon shinin' through,
My wheels keep spinning 'til the night, and I'll be coming home soon
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.",country

Verse 1
A Wednesday morn in the hills of Tennessee 
The wind's a comin' and the cotton's white and clean 
The sun's a shinin', and the birds are singing their song 
And the morning dew can't hide the silence of the dawn 

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Verse 2
A family's home washed away by the raging storm 
A farmer's crop burned up in the heat of the morn 
The road's a river, and the bridge is washed away 
And the echoes of the thunder heard for miles away

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Bridge
The valley's just a whisper, the rolling hills alive 
The farms in tatters and the truth we can't hide 
The songbird's singing of a time we must face 
The judgement of the Lord in a broken land of grace

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day",country

Verse 1
I wake up in the morning, dawning light shone in
With a heavy heart and hurt I can't contain
My arms reach out, searchin' for you in my sleep
But the thunder claps in my soul as I remember you gone

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Verse 2
I head down to the bar, tryin' to drink away my blues
Laughter rings and I shoot some pool with friends, for a moment I'm okay
But when the night closes in and it's just me, oh Lord, I'm overwhelmed
Then I remember that you're not here and deep pain starts to swell

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Bridge
I cry out to the night sky, seeking some kind of sign
But the silence is deafening, your absence is all that I find
And I straighten Miss Emily's picture one last time

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then",country

Verse 1
I was strolling down the street one day,
Thought I'd find some love, nothing to pay,
Saw a girl who looked so fine,
I just couldn't leave her behind.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 2
She said meet me round the corner at half past ten,
Thought my heart would cry, but I went in,
Her room was a place I'd never been,
But something told me I ought to go in.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 3
I thought I'd take her out and buy her a meal,
Naive as a puppy and dammed as a seal,
I thought 'twas true love, but I had it wrong,
I was just another part of her song.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Bridge
Been around the block a few times, now I see the light,
Ain't gonna be fooled again, not by no one tonight,
Gonna find a gal who wants me,
And who knows what real love can be.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.",country

Verse 1 
We left our expectations back on the shoreline 
Took off our worries, left 'em behind 
The sun was settin' low, but the water was so inviting 
We just had to take the risk and take the dive 

Chorus
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions  
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Verse 2 
The night was starry bright, it enveloped us in grace 
The moonlight guided us to a safe place 
No fear of judgement here, 'cause noone could ever see 
We just had to keep believin' and keep our faith 

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions 
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Bridge 
We'll keep on swimmin', in this crystal-clear lake 
We can keep it to ourselves, forever and ever, forever and ever 
And when the waters call us, we'll rise again 
We'll keep on swimmmin', keep our feet on solid ground

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions

Verse 1
I was lost and out of luck,
Searching all the backroads for love
Breaking all the rules, that I made up
Leaving only dust and broken dreams

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Verse 2
Thought I’d never find someone like you
Every stoplight and bar had something to do
Running around, losing again and again
But now I know it was all for a reason

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Bridge
You showed up just in time and knocked on my door
Brought with you sweet sunshine and love evermore
No more searching for love in all the wrong places
God bless the day I discovered you lookin’ for love

Chorus
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about
Now that I’ve found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered you, oh you lookin’ for love",country

Verse 1
The mountain seems so high, with obstacles in my way
I'm struggling to stay strong, so I can make it through the day
I'm reminded of His grace, and of His constant love
He's been here from the start, and will be with me from above

Chorus 
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Verse 2
No matter where I turn, whatever I'm going through
I'm reminded of His Word, and of the hope He gives anew
He'll never forsake me, no matter how I stray
The Lord remains by side, no matter what the cost may be

Chorus
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Bridge
And I will always trust, His promise is sure
His faithfulness will never pass, He's a light that will endure
His mercy never fails, He's by my side when I fall
I know that God is always here, and He'll never leave me at all

Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 2:
Belshazzar's heart was filled with fear
The writing said time was running out
But Daniel held his hand and said,
""Your kingdom shall soon be overthrown""

The writing said his rule had come to an end
The king's fate lay in Daniel's hands
He must surrender the throne to Darius
And to the Lord he must make amends


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 3:
The warning had been given loud and clear
And Belshazzar heeded the call
To avoid the wrath of the Lord
He must give up his throne to all

But Belshazzar's pride and his ignorance lingered still
And he refused to give up his reign
Vengeance was swift and it came with a roar
His kingdom fell and would never be the same


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Outro:
Belshazzar's demise was a lesson for all
Pride goes before a fall
His arrogance was his own downfall
He should've learned to heed the warnings of old",country

Verse 1
It started with a smile, a twinkle in your eye
The way you said my name and how you made me feel alive
But when I was young and naive, I didn't see the signs
And now I'm left to wonder when the truth will be mine

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 2
The lies and secrets that you kept, I still feel betrayed
You took my trust and cast it aside, like it was some kind of game
Was all just part of your plan, lead me on while you can
You might have thought I would fall down, but I'm still rolling on

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 3
You thought you had me fooled, but I'm wiser than you think
Took me for a fool, but still I rise above you
You might have thought I'd give up, but I'm staying strong
I won't let go, this fight is not about to end

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Bridge 
You can't ignore the truth, no matter how hard you try
It's a part of me, and it's here to stay
There's no need to keep trying to turn back the time
I'm moving forward, no more games to play

Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong

Verse 1
I am a young woman livin' in small town Tennessee
My old man works hard all day, just to keep us fed
If wishes were horses and dreams were made of steel
I'd drive this rutted road away to something better than I feel

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 2
They say living's easy now, compared to times before
But all that changes when I'm down here on the floor
I don't want no silver spoon, or a mansion on a hill
I just want a steady job, and someone who'll love me still

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 3
They say there's a brighter day, down a long and winding road
But I can't seem to get there, like I'm stuck in heavy snow
I don't want no fortune, or a bigger pile of gold
Just one thing to keep me going, so I can stay on this road

Make me an angel, who flies from town to town

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares 
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Driving in the night, heading for the light
Feeling free like I'm in flight
Gonna make it through, not gonna be like you
Ain't gonna be your fool no more

Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
Gonna lose your shirt when you dive
Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
I'm the king of the hive

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, like I'm in sin
Blow away all of your cares
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Can't control no more, can't take it like before

Say goodbye to this train, gonna start living again
No I won't be your fool no more

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares

Is hard for us all when we can't hold our own
They talked about us livin' in despair

Verse 1 
Drivin' down the highway, starin' out the window,
Livin' on the lost side of town, feelin' so far away from home.
My heart is runnin' faster, I can't keep still,
I won't admit defeat, tryin' to regain control on this endless wheel.

I can find myself a woman, but no ring could ever be heavy enough,

Rustlin' in the wind, I've been through my darkest days,
The sun can't penetrate the cloud that's been hangin' over me since yesterday.

All hope feelin' so distant as I gave up my fight.

I woke up this mornin' to a dawn so bright,
Heard a bird singin' in the apple tree.
Listenin' to the whisperin' of the wind,
Singin' 'bout a life I once used to live.

Lost my way, just tryin' to find a place to go.
I was lost in my mind, not sure which way to go.
Life can take you down a path so dark,
Still tryin' to find some hope in the dark.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

Hope is hard to find when faith is hard to keep.
And love is hard to find when nobody believes.
Sometimes life can be so cruel, and hard to take,
Still tryin' to find that light to break.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on livin' my life,
Searchin' around for that silver light.
The only way to find my hope and way,
Is to keep prayin' that someday I'll be OK.

Verse 1:
If you see her out tonight, she'll act so strong and standing tall
But in the depths of her heart lies a vulnerability that she'll keep hidden away
She's been broken before, and so now it's hidden behind the wall
And she'll tell you she's alright and she won't need a man tonight, that's what she says

Chorus:
But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets
And not too long ago she swore she'd never let her heart be broken anymore

Verse 2:
Living on a fragile edge, she's trying to stay away from the heartache
But a little bit of love could make her feel alive
Holding on despite the pain, in silent hopes of a brighter tomorrow
But no one knows that she's been longing for a little tenderness

But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets

Red and orange sparks dancing across the pond tonight

Baby we're getting out of here, I could care less where it leads us
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight

Let's head on down this lonesome road, no need for second thoughts
Two hearts living for the moment, ain't no room for nothin else

Verse 1

I've seen a ghost of a faded moonbeam,
As it moved across my windowpane,
Tossing and turning in the chilly night air,
The rain as it was washing away my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 2

Looking at the tracks of the careless windbeam,
Or moving to the tracks of the tireless freight train,
Lit up the sides of the weathervane,
As the bits of rain and the windowpane,
Took away my hopes and my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 3

I've looked for the moonbeam, as it flew away,
Taken away by the summer breeze,
But the ghost of my dreams still lingers on,
As I search for the light of the moonbeam.

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,

I've been wandering on a road so long, 
Open skies my only home, 
But I've never felt so lost and so alone, 
Until I found a new way to roam.

Ain't know how to take back control, 
I heard a voice it made me change, 
I ain't ashamed to let you know.

When the struggle is so hard,
Follow the dreams, keep searchin for the truth,
The answers waiting for you in your heart.

So many trials, all along the way, 
Battles coming from all sides, 
Willie's voice, gives me strength to stay, 
Like a miracle he saw me through the night.

And I know what would Willie do, 
If he was here for me now,
He'd smile so strong and take me by the hand, 
And show me a better way somehow.

Snappy new jeans and her boots all tight

Got no reason to care what anyone's thinkin'

The sun sets in the west, and I see the spark in your eyes
As you turn around and whisper, we found a special kind of love

Begging you to come back, make it right
Take my hand and I'll never let go, sweet Ophelia

Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Ah, out here in the country, ain't nobody pushing us
Time heals all wounds, if you just let it do its thing
So don't let your heart be shoved, but just let it wander free
Take a breath and relax, don't let nobody rush thee

Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Nothing can keep us apart, when the journey's oh so long

Verse 1 
It's been quite a while since I last saw your face 
I replay all the moments, can't find my place 
I never really knew when it all went wrong 
It's too late to reverse, it won't be long 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head 
Way back when the world was young 
Long before this song was sung 
I know someone must have hurt like me 

Verse 2 
Tried my best to please you, you took my love for granted 
Cried my eyes out for you, but you never changed it 
I don't regret the day I laid my eyes on you 
But I regret the way I lost my point of view 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head

Bridge 
No one can tell me why I keep hanging on 
Can't unlock the feelings I can't seem to move on

At where I lost the thread

My life has been a broken round, 
Full of trials and no peace to be found. 
Never understood the why or the how, 
But I’d search for an answer right now.

A rose for affection and a thorn for my heart, 
Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start. 
I run in the night, I wait in the light, 
In shadows of darkness, and music I recite.

A letter by the door, I thought that it was more, 
Cashmere for the weather and wool for the cold. 
A bed made of feathers, my mask made of lies, 
My broken soul drowning in a sea of goodbye.

Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start.

Every move we make requires a fool.
One wrong step is all it takes,

As I take this road to find a better place
The memories of her still linger in my veins
I want to find a way to make things right again
But I'm searching for a way back to Harlan County Line

I see her face in my dreams and I know it's true
That I never should have left that place without you
One thousand miles and I'm still trying to forget
Cause I can't go back to the Harlan County Line

I hear the wind whistling through the trees
The rivers flowing and the birds singing in the breeze
The coal dust in the air fills my memory
Of that sweet little girl I used to know back in Harlan County Line

The cattle down in the valley are mooing in the night
The riverbanks are still singing in the moonlight
My heart is full of longing and I can't deny
That I'm wanting to find my way back to the Harlan County Line

The sun is setting in the West and the stars are startin to shine
I'm thinking back to all the places I've been and all the love I left behind
I still remember all the kindness they showed me there
But I can't go back to the Harlan County Line

No matter where I go, it's here that I want to stay
I'm just searchin for a way to find my peace of mind

Gave up my home in London England
Hungry for warmer sunsets
So I hopped a plane and made my way
To Lincoln Nebraska instead
Crossed the Atlantic and the States
Could hardly believe the view
Left New York and drove all night
Missouri said “hello” to me

The city offers me a steady place
A new home with new roads
Can’t help but feel a little overwhelmed

A promise of a place to call my own
A new journey has begun
That I can call my own

Georgia was my last kiss goodbye
Ran through the night, steam all around me
To see what this Midwest life would bring
Louisville, Indianapolis, flew like the blink of an eye
And before I knew it, Nebraska was in sight

My motor's runnin' on empty, out on this lonesome road
I'm lookin' for a place, and somewhere to call my home
I drove into this bar, and stepped up onto the stool
The bartender said, ""What'll it be, now, son?""

And I said,

""I'm just lookin' for a little solace, some sweet relief
A beer will do just fine, to help me ease my grief
The place was filled with a mighty crowd, and I'm all by myself
But I shook it off, and this is what I said""

""Hello, lonesome stranger, livin' life on the run
Sure hope you find your fill, and someplace you can call home
I've seen the darkness and the light, and I know it can be done
So don't you give up now, my lonesome stranger, son""

The years they rolled on by, I finally found my way
To a house and some friends, and now I'm here to stay
But I'm still on the road, when I'm searchin' for the truth
Until I find my heart, I'll keep rolling on my boots

""So long, lonesome stranger, livin' life on the run
You never gave up hope, so now you can call this home
The past was rough, it's true, but you kept on goin' strong
You kept pressin' on, goodbye, my lonesome stranger, son""",country

Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends
Tell 'em I'm still rollin' but I ain't going round in circles

Lost in my lonesome county and it's hard to bear
Pain and sorrow linger on, and I'm still standing there
Fate's hand holds tight on my every move
But I'm not afraid of life no matter what it throws at me

Hey mama when you leave, don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothing, I can't use nothing
Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends

Bridge:
My fate is sealed and my spirit never lies
These are the precious things, and the only words worth remembering
You take what you get, and you smile through the pain
Cause being born is going blind, and bowing down a thousand times

Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends

Lookin' out at the Savannah from my front porch light
Barely a whisper of wind on this cool summer night
My heart feels so hollow, I'm so empty inside
Just hopin' for that special one to come and fill my life

Blue moon, ain't nobody ever been so sad and so alone

" it s seen a lot of tan legs got a kick ass radio heard alot of singing along with some country songs and rock and roll got a 38 bullet hole courtesy of kate tillman s dad alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs he said if i don t come back you can have this ford just tape a picture of me on the dashboard 

He drove away in a cloud of dust as I waved goodbye
I watched as his truck disappeared on that summer night
I knew that if he didn't make it back his old truck was mine 
And I just had to keep the dashboard in its time

It's seen a lot of pickups and flags, of honor and pride
Heard a lot of stories, of laughter and tears in the night
And I'd see the bullet hole from Kate Tillman's dad 
It's been witness to a lot of memories that I'm glad I had 

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford
With the stories it told, it's a memory I'll always hold
For his sacrifice I'll keep it safe and sound
With his picture on the dashboard, that truck won't let me down

I pulled it out of the garage and the smell brought him back
The wear and tear of a veteran truck, in my heart it did attack
Still got a kick ass radio and a dive bar view
I thought of my brother and all the days we had, and what he went through

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford
With the stories it told, it's a memory I'll always hold
For his sacrifice I'll keep it safe and sound
With his picture on the dashboard, that truck won't let me down

When I'm out on the open road with that truck, it takes me back
To the times when we'd laugh and joke, never worry about attack
As I cruise down that highway, the stories still live on
On the dashboard of his old ford, I think of him and I'm gone 

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford

She's standing in the country night,
In the lights of the distant fair,
The emotion ringing in her eyes so clear,
It's more than I can bear.
Torn between what I'm feeling and what I should do,
Cause I'm stuck in a world that's so right,
And I can't keep it inside, these thoughts of loving her that won't subside.

So keep on walking on little girl,
Cause it's only you that's missing.
Oh my lord, she walks on by,
She wonders what is wrong with me,
And I left a world in her little hands,
But it's not her fault for the way that she fell.

The pain that I see in her eyes,
She's lost out on love again,
I try to catch her but I can't compete,
In this game I just can't win.
And I'm standing in the shadows as I watch her go,
But I know that I'd talk to her if only I could show,
That my love's been here all along,
But it's just not that strong.

And the girl of my dreams was just a distant song.
You asked me how I could be feeling so low, 
But you'd feel the same if your heart had been broken in two.

So play me a Hank song to ease my pain, 
It helps to know that someone felt the same.

My Stetson shadows my eyes, but I'm not afraid
To show the world that underneath I just craved a different way

Out here, life's a wild ride and the fate of man hangs by a thread
The lawmen chased me to the edge, but of mercy they had to be fed

And the federales said they could have had me, but out of kindness I had to hide

Day after day, desperados took their toll
And their days of doin' wrong, they just had to go

I can't believe that you've stopped loving me. 

Bridge: 
Tomorrow I'll say, ""Happy birthday darling!"" 
I'll come home and surprise you with a gift, 
My arms are reaching out for you, 
I can't forget you just because you're gone. 

Chorus: 
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me, 
It's too much for me to comprehend 
How can something so real become just a dream, 
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me, 
It's like a nightmare that I just can't shake, 
It feels like my heart has been laid to waste, 
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me.",country

Verse 1
He had a pickup truck, a thirty-aught-six
An ice cold beer and a tune to fix
His friends at the fire, light up the night
Momma's cookin up, some of her best bites

Chorus
Sweet summer, yeah I remember that sweet summer
Let me take you back in time
Where the days felt so slow and you never felt low
The summertime was fine

Verse 2
The stars in the sky were so bright
The sound of laughter 'til late at night
Canoein' down the river, fishin' in the creek
The endless love we had for each other was unique

Chorus
Sweet summer, yeah I remember that sweet summer
Let me take you back in time
Where the days felt so slow and you never felt low
The summertime was fine

Bridge
Oh, the kind of love and sweet memories we'd make
That sweet summer, running wild and free
Bringin' us together and makin' us better
That sweet summer, we could never forget

Chorus
Sweet summer, yeah I remember that sweet summer
Let me take you back in time
Where the days felt so slow and you never felt low
The summertime was fine",country

Verse 1
Well I'm a lonely cowboy on the range,
Traveling all night, just to find a change,
Searching for the one who stole my heart,
She's the one I've been longing for from the start.

Chorus
So I'm heading back home, back home to the west,
Where my true love awaits me, I've got nothing to test,
Back home to the mountains and the badlands,
Where the sun sets warm and the stars shine bright.

Verse 2
Night rides and campfires, trail rides and hay,
Long days under the sun, while the moon's up to stay,
My heart's in my chest and I'm ready to go,
Hoping to find the one I truly know.

Chorus
So I'm heading back home, back home to the west,
Where my true love awaits me, I've got nothing to test,
Back home to the mountains and the badlands,
Where the sun sets warm and the stars shine bright.

Verse 3
Finding my way back home, with my heart in my hands,
The dice have been thrown, a brand new plan,
If I ever find her, I'll kiss her sweet face,
And love her forever in this wild western place.

Chorus
So I'm heading back home, back home to the west,
Where my true love awaits me, I've got nothing to test,
Back home to the mountains and the badlands,
Where the sun sets warm and the stars shine bright.",country
