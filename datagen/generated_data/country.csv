Ride on my pony, ride to the fields,
Watch the sun rise on a summer day.
The sweet smell of the flowers that bloom,
Gives me a feeling that won't go away.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses,
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.

Trot on the river, trot on the lake,
Dance with the wind in an open space.
The stars light the way in the middle of the night,
Giving us light, a magical place.

Hush a bye, don't you cry, go to sleep, my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have cake, and all the pretty little horses, 
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, all the pretty, pretty horses.",country
" 

Passing through that Colorado town, I'm tryin' to make it Oklahoma, 
Just one more stop along the way, then I know I'm gonna make it alright
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as fast as I can.

Rollin' on down the dusty road, my wheels are spinning 'neath the sun,
Smells of coal, smokestack's high, with a load I gotta get done
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

I've been livin' on the road, I got no time for a plan,
The highway's my home and my bed, that's where I'll lay my head 
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.

The sky is dark, the stars have come, a bright moon shinin' through,
My wheels keep spinning 'til the night, and I'll be coming home soon
I'm a hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man, hard drivin' man,
I'm drivin' just as hard as I can.",country

Verse 1
A Wednesday morn in the hills of Tennessee 
The wind's a comin' and the cotton's white and clean 
The sun's a shinin', and the birds are singing their song 
And the morning dew can't hide the silence of the dawn 

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Verse 2
A family's home washed away by the raging storm 
A farmer's crop burned up in the heat of the morn 
The road's a river, and the bridge is washed away 
And the echoes of the thunder heard for miles away

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day

Bridge
The valley's just a whisper, the rolling hills alive 
The farms in tatters and the truth we can't hide 
The songbird's singing of a time we must face 
The judgement of the Lord in a broken land of grace

Chorus 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day 
Watch out for the ego's eye and the opium on the breakfast tray 
Or the laughter of the dying monk from the poison of the tsetse fly 
All the mountains they have no sides and the robbers they have a thousand lies 
You can see it all in the rivers of Shanghai 
Another monsoon's here and it feels like judgment day",country

Verse 1
I wake up in the morning, dawning light shone in
With a heavy heart and hurt I can't contain
My arms reach out, searchin' for you in my sleep
But the thunder claps in my soul as I remember you gone

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Verse 2
I head down to the bar, tryin' to drink away my blues
Laughter rings and I shoot some pool with friends, for a moment I'm okay
But when the night closes in and it's just me, oh Lord, I'm overwhelmed
Then I remember that you're not here and deep pain starts to swell

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then

Bridge
I cry out to the night sky, seeking some kind of sign
But the silence is deafening, your absence is all that I find
And I straighten Miss Emily's picture one last time

Chorus
I look out my window, see a sky so blue
But all that I can feel is the pain lookin' back at me
All that my future holds, the loneliness I must uphold
As I toss yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then",country

Verse 1
I was strolling down the street one day,
Thought I'd find some love, nothing to pay,
Saw a girl who looked so fine,
I just couldn't leave her behind.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 2
She said meet me round the corner at half past ten,
Thought my heart would cry, but I went in,
Her room was a place I'd never been,
But something told me I ought to go in.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Verse 3
I thought I'd take her out and buy her a meal,
Naive as a puppy and dammed as a seal,
I thought 'twas true love, but I had it wrong,
I was just another part of her song.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.

Bridge
Been around the block a few times, now I see the light,
Ain't gonna be fooled again, not by no one tonight,
Gonna find a gal who wants me,
And who knows what real love can be.

Chorus
She's a noted rider, whoa she ain't no good,
She got drunk this morning, Woke up her neighbours,
She took me to her house, she called me honey,
Thought she loved me, but she just wanted my money.",country

Verse 1 
We left our expectations back on the shoreline 
Took off our worries, left 'em behind 
The sun was settin' low, but the water was so inviting 
We just had to take the risk and take the dive 

Chorus
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions  
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Verse 2 
The night was starry bright, it enveloped us in grace 
The moonlight guided us to a safe place 
No fear of judgement here, 'cause noone could ever see 
We just had to keep believin' and keep our faith 

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions 
The cold ocean far away, enter the sun marchin' like a matador 
Throwin' a red cape on the sky, my butterfly, I'll dance with you 
Though our wings may crumble, we can float like ash 
Broken, but our edges still shine 

Bridge 
We'll keep on swimmin', in this crystal-clear lake 
We can keep it to ourselves, forever and ever, forever and ever 
And when the waters call us, we'll rise again 
We'll keep on swimmmin', keep our feet on solid ground

Chorus 
Lake swimmin', shuckin' free our deadened selves like snakes and corn do 
Our bodies tore off swimmin' suits and all the old notions

Verse 1
I was lost and out of luck,
Searching all the backroads for love
Breaking all the rules, that I made up
Leaving only dust and broken dreams

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Verse 2
Thought I’d never find someone like you
Every stoplight and bar had something to do
Running around, losing again and again
But now I know it was all for a reason

Chorus
I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about

Bridge
You showed up just in time and knocked on my door
Brought with you sweet sunshine and love evermore
No more searching for love in all the wrong places
God bless the day I discovered you lookin’ for love

Chorus
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places
Searching for something that’ll never be found
Scanning their eyes, hoping to find traces
Of the love that I’ve been dreaming about
Now that I’ve found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered you, oh you lookin’ for love",country

Verse 1
The mountain seems so high, with obstacles in my way
I'm struggling to stay strong, so I can make it through the day
I'm reminded of His grace, and of His constant love
He's been here from the start, and will be with me from above

Chorus 
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Verse 2
No matter where I turn, whatever I'm going through
I'm reminded of His Word, and of the hope He gives anew
He'll never forsake me, no matter how I stray
The Lord remains by side, no matter what the cost may be

Chorus
Though the questions may remain, and the future's still unclear
God is here with open arms and a never-ending cheer
His love and mercy show, no matter where I go
He's with me always, His grace will never leave me

Bridge
And I will always trust, His promise is sure
His faithfulness will never pass, He's a light that will endure
His mercy never fails, He's by my side when I fall
I know that God is always here, and He'll never leave me at all

Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 2:
Belshazzar's heart was filled with fear
The writing said time was running out
But Daniel held his hand and said,
""Your kingdom shall soon be overthrown""

The writing said his rule had come to an end
The king's fate lay in Daniel's hands
He must surrender the throne to Darius
And to the Lord he must make amends


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand

Verse 3:
The warning had been given loud and clear
And Belshazzar heeded the call
To avoid the wrath of the Lord
He must give up his throne to all

But Belshazzar's pride and his ignorance lingered still
And he refused to give up his reign
Vengeance was swift and it came with a roar
His kingdom fell and would never be the same


Chorus:
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Outro:
Belshazzar's demise was a lesson for all
Pride goes before a fall
His arrogance was his own downfall
He should've learned to heed the warnings of old",country

Verse 1
It started with a smile, a twinkle in your eye
The way you said my name and how you made me feel alive
But when I was young and naive, I didn't see the signs
And now I'm left to wonder when the truth will be mine

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 2
The lies and secrets that you kept, I still feel betrayed
You took my trust and cast it aside, like it was some kind of game
Was all just part of your plan, lead me on while you can
You might have thought I would fall down, but I'm still rolling on

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Verse 3
You thought you had me fooled, but I'm wiser than you think
Took me for a fool, but still I rise above you
You might have thought I'd give up, but I'm staying strong
I won't let go, this fight is not about to end

Chorus
Just because I forgave you, doesn't mean that I'll forget
The way you hurt me, how you treated me so wrong
Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong
It's clear to see, you thought I was no longer useful

Bridge 
You can't ignore the truth, no matter how hard you try
It's a part of me, and it's here to stay
There's no need to keep trying to turn back the time
I'm moving forward, no more games to play

Tried to break me down, but I'm still standing strong

Verse 1
I am a young woman livin' in small town Tennessee
My old man works hard all day, just to keep us fed
If wishes were horses and dreams were made of steel
I'd drive this rutted road away to something better than I feel

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 2
They say living's easy now, compared to times before
But all that changes when I'm down here on the floor
I don't want no silver spoon, or a mansion on a hill
I just want a steady job, and someone who'll love me still

Chorus
Make me an angel, who flies from town to town
Make me a poster of a small country rodeo
Just show me one thing that I can hold onto
To believe in this livin's just a hard way to go

Verse 3
They say there's a brighter day, down a long and winding road
But I can't seem to get there, like I'm stuck in heavy snow
I don't want no fortune, or a bigger pile of gold
Just one thing to keep me going, so I can stay on this road

Make me an angel, who flies from town to town

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares 
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Driving in the night, heading for the light
Feeling free like I'm in flight
Gonna make it through, not gonna be like you
Ain't gonna be your fool no more

Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
Gonna lose your shirt when you dive
Oh, big gambler, up on a ladder
I'm the king of the hive

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, like I'm in sin
Blow away all of your cares
Fading fast, life's no longer here

Can't control no more, can't take it like before

Say goodbye to this train, gonna start living again
No I won't be your fool no more

Come and go, riding the wind
Feeling high, it's been a sin
Blow away all of your cares

Is hard for us all when we can't hold our own
They talked about us livin' in despair

Verse 1 
Drivin' down the highway, starin' out the window,
Livin' on the lost side of town, feelin' so far away from home.
My heart is runnin' faster, I can't keep still,
I won't admit defeat, tryin' to regain control on this endless wheel.

I can find myself a woman, but no ring could ever be heavy enough,

Rustlin' in the wind, I've been through my darkest days,
The sun can't penetrate the cloud that's been hangin' over me since yesterday.

All hope feelin' so distant as I gave up my fight.

I woke up this mornin' to a dawn so bright,
Heard a bird singin' in the apple tree.
Listenin' to the whisperin' of the wind,
Singin' 'bout a life I once used to live.

Lost my way, just tryin' to find a place to go.
I was lost in my mind, not sure which way to go.
Life can take you down a path so dark,
Still tryin' to find some hope in the dark.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

Hope is hard to find when faith is hard to keep.
And love is hard to find when nobody believes.
Sometimes life can be so cruel, and hard to take,
Still tryin' to find that light to break.

Chorus:
Lies, lies, lies, my blood on fire.
Broken dreams that I can't deny.
Livin' life with a heavy load,
Trying to find a way to cross that narrow road.

I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on livin' my life,
Searchin' around for that silver light.
The only way to find my hope and way,
Is to keep prayin' that someday I'll be OK.

Verse 1:
If you see her out tonight, she'll act so strong and standing tall
But in the depths of her heart lies a vulnerability that she'll keep hidden away
She's been broken before, and so now it's hidden behind the wall
And she'll tell you she's alright and she won't need a man tonight, that's what she says

Chorus:
But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets
And not too long ago she swore she'd never let her heart be broken anymore

Verse 2:
Living on a fragile edge, she's trying to stay away from the heartache
But a little bit of love could make her feel alive
Holding on despite the pain, in silent hopes of a brighter tomorrow
But no one knows that she's been longing for a little tenderness

But sometimes she forgets, yeah that's what she tells you
But don't give up cause sometimes she forgets

Red and orange sparks dancing across the pond tonight

Baby we're getting out of here, I could care less where it leads us
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight

Let's head on down this lonesome road, no need for second thoughts
Two hearts living for the moment, ain't no room for nothin else

Verse 1

I've seen a ghost of a faded moonbeam,
As it moved across my windowpane,
Tossing and turning in the chilly night air,
The rain as it was washing away my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 2

Looking at the tracks of the careless windbeam,
Or moving to the tracks of the tireless freight train,
Lit up the sides of the weathervane,
As the bits of rain and the windowpane,
Took away my hopes and my dreams.

Chorus

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,
Or danced about the weathervane,
Or sat along a moving train,
And wondered where the train has been?

Verse 3

I've looked for the moonbeam, as it flew away,
Taken away by the summer breeze,
But the ghost of my dreams still lingers on,
As I search for the light of the moonbeam.

Have you ever watched a moonbeam as it slid across your windowpane,
Or struggled with a bit of rain,

I've been wandering on a road so long, 
Open skies my only home, 
But I've never felt so lost and so alone, 
Until I found a new way to roam.

Ain't know how to take back control, 
I heard a voice it made me change, 
I ain't ashamed to let you know.

When the struggle is so hard,
Follow the dreams, keep searchin for the truth,
The answers waiting for you in your heart.

So many trials, all along the way, 
Battles coming from all sides, 
Willie's voice, gives me strength to stay, 
Like a miracle he saw me through the night.

And I know what would Willie do, 
If he was here for me now,
He'd smile so strong and take me by the hand, 
And show me a better way somehow.

Snappy new jeans and her boots all tight

Got no reason to care what anyone's thinkin'

The sun sets in the west, and I see the spark in your eyes
As you turn around and whisper, we found a special kind of love

Begging you to come back, make it right
Take my hand and I'll never let go, sweet Ophelia

Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Ah, out here in the country, ain't nobody pushing us
Time heals all wounds, if you just let it do its thing
So don't let your heart be shoved, but just let it wander free
Take a breath and relax, don't let nobody rush thee

Gotta just give it time now baby
Gotta just give it time now baby

Nothing can keep us apart, when the journey's oh so long

Verse 1 
It's been quite a while since I last saw your face 
I replay all the moments, can't find my place 
I never really knew when it all went wrong 
It's too late to reverse, it won't be long 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head 
Way back when the world was young 
Long before this song was sung 
I know someone must have hurt like me 

Verse 2 
Tried my best to please you, you took my love for granted 
Cried my eyes out for you, but you never changed it 
I don't regret the day I laid my eyes on you 
But I regret the way I lost my point of view 

Chorus 
I'm stuck here looking back 
At where I lost the thread 
So ashamed here thinking back 
At how I lost my head

Bridge 
No one can tell me why I keep hanging on 
Can't unlock the feelings I can't seem to move on

At where I lost the thread

My life has been a broken round, 
Full of trials and no peace to be found. 
Never understood the why or the how, 
But I’d search for an answer right now.

A rose for affection and a thorn for my heart, 
Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start. 
I run in the night, I wait in the light, 
In shadows of darkness, and music I recite.

A letter by the door, I thought that it was more, 
Cashmere for the weather and wool for the cold. 
A bed made of feathers, my mask made of lies, 
My broken soul drowning in a sea of goodbye.

Diamonds for rejection, that’s a good place to start.

Every move we make requires a fool.
One wrong step is all it takes,

As I take this road to find a better place
The memories of her still linger in my veins
I want to find a way to make things right again
But I'm searching for a way back to Harlan County Line

I see her face in my dreams and I know it's true
That I never should have left that place without you
One thousand miles and I'm still trying to forget
Cause I can't go back to the Harlan County Line

I hear the wind whistling through the trees
The rivers flowing and the birds singing in the breeze
The coal dust in the air fills my memory
Of that sweet little girl I used to know back in Harlan County Line

The cattle down in the valley are mooing in the night
The riverbanks are still singing in the moonlight
My heart is full of longing and I can't deny
That I'm wanting to find my way back to the Harlan County Line

The sun is setting in the West and the stars are startin to shine
I'm thinking back to all the places I've been and all the love I left behind
I still remember all the kindness they showed me there
But I can't go back to the Harlan County Line

No matter where I go, it's here that I want to stay
I'm just searchin for a way to find my peace of mind

Gave up my home in London England
Hungry for warmer sunsets
So I hopped a plane and made my way
To Lincoln Nebraska instead
Crossed the Atlantic and the States
Could hardly believe the view
Left New York and drove all night
Missouri said “hello” to me

The city offers me a steady place
A new home with new roads
Can’t help but feel a little overwhelmed

A promise of a place to call my own
A new journey has begun
That I can call my own

Georgia was my last kiss goodbye
Ran through the night, steam all around me
To see what this Midwest life would bring
Louisville, Indianapolis, flew like the blink of an eye
And before I knew it, Nebraska was in sight

My motor's runnin' on empty, out on this lonesome road
I'm lookin' for a place, and somewhere to call my home
I drove into this bar, and stepped up onto the stool
The bartender said, ""What'll it be, now, son?""

And I said,

""I'm just lookin' for a little solace, some sweet relief
A beer will do just fine, to help me ease my grief
The place was filled with a mighty crowd, and I'm all by myself
But I shook it off, and this is what I said""

""Hello, lonesome stranger, livin' life on the run
Sure hope you find your fill, and someplace you can call home
I've seen the darkness and the light, and I know it can be done
So don't you give up now, my lonesome stranger, son""

The years they rolled on by, I finally found my way
To a house and some friends, and now I'm here to stay
But I'm still on the road, when I'm searchin' for the truth
Until I find my heart, I'll keep rolling on my boots

""So long, lonesome stranger, livin' life on the run
You never gave up hope, so now you can call this home
The past was rough, it's true, but you kept on goin' strong
You kept pressin' on, goodbye, my lonesome stranger, son""",country

Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends
Tell 'em I'm still rollin' but I ain't going round in circles

Lost in my lonesome county and it's hard to bear
Pain and sorrow linger on, and I'm still standing there
Fate's hand holds tight on my every move
But I'm not afraid of life no matter what it throws at me

Hey mama when you leave, don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothing, I can't use nothing
Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends

Bridge:
My fate is sealed and my spirit never lies
These are the precious things, and the only words worth remembering
You take what you get, and you smile through the pain
Cause being born is going blind, and bowing down a thousand times

Take care out on the road, and if you see my friends

Lookin' out at the Savannah from my front porch light
Barely a whisper of wind on this cool summer night
My heart feels so hollow, I'm so empty inside
Just hopin' for that special one to come and fill my life

Blue moon, ain't nobody ever been so sad and so alone

" it s seen a lot of tan legs got a kick ass radio heard alot of singing along with some country songs and rock and roll got a 38 bullet hole courtesy of kate tillman s dad alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs he said if i don t come back you can have this ford just tape a picture of me on the dashboard 

He drove away in a cloud of dust as I waved goodbye
I watched as his truck disappeared on that summer night
I knew that if he didn't make it back his old truck was mine 
And I just had to keep the dashboard in its time

It's seen a lot of pickups and flags, of honor and pride
Heard a lot of stories, of laughter and tears in the night
And I'd see the bullet hole from Kate Tillman's dad 
It's been witness to a lot of memories that I'm glad I had 

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford
With the stories it told, it's a memory I'll always hold
For his sacrifice I'll keep it safe and sound
With his picture on the dashboard, that truck won't let me down

I pulled it out of the garage and the smell brought him back
The wear and tear of a veteran truck, in my heart it did attack
Still got a kick ass radio and a dive bar view
I thought of my brother and all the days we had, and what he went through

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford
With the stories it told, it's a memory I'll always hold
For his sacrifice I'll keep it safe and sound
With his picture on the dashboard, that truck won't let me down

When I'm out on the open road with that truck, it takes me back
To the times when we'd laugh and joke, never worry about attack
As I cruise down that highway, the stories still live on
On the dashboard of his old ford, I think of him and I'm gone 

Chorus:
And I'll never forget the dashboard of his old ford

She's standing in the country night,
In the lights of the distant fair,
The emotion ringing in her eyes so clear,
It's more than I can bear.
Torn between what I'm feeling and what I should do,
Cause I'm stuck in a world that's so right,
And I can't keep it inside, these thoughts of loving her that won't subside.

So keep on walking on little girl,
Cause it's only you that's missing.
Oh my lord, she walks on by,
She wonders what is wrong with me,
And I left a world in her little hands,
But it's not her fault for the way that she fell.

The pain that I see in her eyes,
She's lost out on love again,
I try to catch her but I can't compete,
In this game I just can't win.
And I'm standing in the shadows as I watch her go,
But I know that I'd talk to her if only I could show,
That my love's been here all along,
But it's just not that strong.

And the girl of my dreams was just a distant song.
You asked me how I could be feeling so low, 
But you'd feel the same if your heart had been broken in two.

So play me a Hank song to ease my pain, 
It helps to know that someone felt the same.

My Stetson shadows my eyes, but I'm not afraid
To show the world that underneath I just craved a different way

Out here, life's a wild ride and the fate of man hangs by a thread
The lawmen chased me to the edge, but of mercy they had to be fed

And the federales said they could have had me, but out of kindness I had to hide

Day after day, desperados took their toll
And their days of doin' wrong, they just had to go

An ice cold beer and a tune to fix

Traveling all night, just to find a change,
Searching for the one who stole my heart,
She's the one I've been longing for from the start.

Long days under the sun, while the moon's up to stay,

Leavin' behind all my worries as I go
Needin' to find something I can call my own

There's a starry night here in Tennessee,
Lights are shakin' up in the distance my heart can see,
I've been makin' my way, tryin' to move on up,
No matter what life sends my way I won't give up.

So I'm gonna roll out on this country road,
Take a chance, won't let this path go untold,
I'm gonna spread my wings and reach for the stars,
Catch a dream and move on past the bar.

Guitar pickin' and a twang of steel,
Soulful words of pain and love I feel,
Lyrics of this life that I have to live on,
Makin' music for the pleasure it brings me and those who come along.

I'm gonna roll out and make this journey last,
Takin' chances and takin' what's meant to pass,
Gonna leave the doubters in my rear view mirror,
Ain't nobody gonna get in the way of what I'm meant to be.

I'm gonna roll out, a runaway train,
I'm gonna do what's right, ain't gonna cause no strain,
I'm gonna travel this road and leave nothin' behind,
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, I'm gonna make my destiny mine.

I'm gonna roll out, a runaway train,
Lookin' forward, no more lookin' back again,
Keepin' both feet on the ground, won't ever look back,
Gonna go on livin', I'm gonna make my dreams come true, and that's a fact.",country

Verse 1
He was a trucker down in Alabama, tryin' to make some cash
He drove on through the night, haulin' moonshine, corn whiskey and hash
On the back roads of Tennessee, an undercover cop was there
He got him and booked him, never thought he'd escape a life of despair

Chorus
And the walls came tumblin' down
Never saw 'em when they stood, never saw 'em when they fell
And the walls came tumblin' down
In the land of the free, where trouble still dwells

Verse 2
He was an outlaw in Arkansas, he'd broken just about every law
He owned a stake of land, but still worked as far away as he saw
When the law came searchin' for him, he hid in the mountains of Maine
Trying to dodge the bounty hunters was a game of hide and seek

Chorus
And the walls came tumblin' down
Never saw 'em when they stood, never saw 'em when they fell

In the land of the free, where trouble still dwells

Verse 3
He was a jailbird in Kansas, found guilty of grand theft auto
He'd do anything to make a buck, he'd rob a bank or swindle a soul
The law was never far behind him, no matter what disguise he wore
He didn't care about the consequences, from Texas to the shores

Livin' down in Tennessee, we heard a sad tale of woe
About a man and a woman livin' down by the river low
They try to make a livin', whatever way they can
Selling cases of whiskey, and the finest smoke in the land

Chorus

And the walls came down all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standin'

Verse 2

They loaded up the Caddy with a load of corn whiskey 
They took to the back roads, out runnin' from the law
Though they tried to be careful, they could never seem to last
Caught by the sheriff, with a bag of contraband

Chorus

And the walls came down all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standin'

Verse 3

The sheriff took them back to town, the judge had no mercy
Sentencing them to five years, like the devil himself had cursed em'
They always said, they'd make it out one day
Though angels would have to come and carry 'em away

But one faithful night, the guard seemed to look the other way
The couple snuck out, one last time to make it far away
With the sunrise, the news spread like wildfire
Their freedom is a symbol of heart, freedom and desire

Verse 1 
I've been here before all these broken roads, 
With the heartache and the hurt and the pain it holds. 
I've been up, I've been down and I can see clear, 
I'm ready to try a different way this year. 

Chorus 
So I'm giving in without you it's too rough, 
I'm standing here again and I'm had enough. 
I've finally realise it's love that never dies, 
And I'm really not that tough, no I'm really not that tough. 

Verse 2 
I can't go back to where I came, 
I'm learning how to let my heart break the chains. 
So I'm here again and I'm not scared, 
Cause I don't want to miss the joy love can share. 

Chorus 
So I'm giving in without you it's too rough, 
I'm standing here again and I'm had enough. 
I've finally realise it's love that never dies, 
And I'm really not that tough, no I'm really not that tough. 

Bridge 
The past is gone and I'm moving on, 
And I'm gonna find a new way home. 
Cause no one can take away the love we make, 
It will be written on my heart when I'm gone.

So I'm giving in without you it's too rough,

But love is something I don't understand
The miles I traveled kept me away too long
My heart has been broken and I just don't belong

The road I'm travellin' is so hard and long
But thoughts of you make my love so strong
My dreams of us never quite seem to come true
If I'm ever gonna find my way I'll need a little bit of you

Verse 1:
Just a small town boy, trying to make it on my own, 
I had no one there to lend me a hand and guide me home
But I had a dream, and a hollerin' to do, 
So I hopped on a train bound for anywhere but here

Chorus:
Oh, they don't know my name, but that's okay
They didn't know my story, yet they still showed me the way
And I know nothing can stop me, I'm destined for the stars
Just know that I'm thankful, for all the love I've known

Verse 2:
Heading out on this highway, stars above my head
Getting closer to the place I want to be
But I don't want to get too far, that old life was part of me
And I'm sure I'll hear them hollerin' in the wind one day

Chorus:
Oh, they don't know my name, but that's okay
They didn't know my story, yet they still showed me the way

It's been five years since I left, but I'm finally on my way

I take them out from time to time, reminiscing what we once had
I think of all the stories that my folks told me, something I'll never lack
I guess it's written in my genes, these guns become apart of me
They've been there for the rides up north, for the Texas to the Utah scene

Chorus 1:
I got the guns that were passed down the line
From my nana and papa, but now they're mine
They've been to Utah and all the way back,
Colorado, Wyoming and the Grand Canyon too
On hunting trips in the freezing snow, always up before the sun
These old guns are apart of me, I got the guns

Verse 2:
I never had the chance to meet him, much too young to see his face
He passed away on the Corpus Christi Bay, when I was just a babe
A Christian man, my grandfather, he ran the nursery near the church
Amazin' Grace, I can still hear him singing, somethin' I'll never search

Chorus 2:
I've seen the tears in grown men's eyes when they speak of their grandpa
And laugh about how he spoiled them all, a tradition he will pass on
No memories of my own, of our time that we shared
So I keep hanging onto his old guns

Bridge:
Nana was here for Christmas of '79, the only daughter's son
My sister's innocent wish of that year, dear Lord bring Nana back to us
Instead she got her earrings, old-time clip-ons and a smile that would never fade
At eight years old, I got the guns, a part of me that will never change

Chorus 3:
A 16-gauge and my grandmother's 410, a 270 that my dad fired once
He brought a mule deer in and that's where I found it
I keep these guns to remind me of him, of his faith and all his love
No matter what life brings, his strength is still around me when I hold his guns",country

Searchin' for solace from this life I've acquired.

Way down south of Hudson Bay,
The warmth of that same love that I'd found,
Had no choice but to go away.

On my mission to the girl in Saskatoon,
I'm freezing but I'm burning in my heart,
Gonna go and find the one I love.

Heading south and west, beneath the cold December sun,
I slept in the carragana when my journey was done,
And in the early morning light, we'd both press onward 'till noon,
Anxious to reunite with the girl in Saskatoon.

On my mission to the girl in Saskatoon,

The prairie lilies grew in abundance on my way,
The church steeple loomed against the prairie moon,
To find my true love, the girl in Saskatoon.

Today could be the day where I finally settle down

Where I'm from,
The Lord's blessed us with all of His grace
Where I'm from,
We're always striving to make it a better place

School Days are memories,
Now its time to find my way
Had my heart broke a few times,
But we still feel the same

You'd be surprised what you learn,
When your feet stay in the same place.
Living life day by day,
That's just the way it goes,

Where I'm from,
The Lord's blessed us with all of His grace
Where I'm from,
We're always striving to make it a better place.

We've all made mistakes,
But we've all grown from them too
The bond of family,
Is something that's never been broken

We're all trying to make a livin,
With our heads held up high
Our Southern drawl is something that'll never die

Where I'm from,
The Lord's blessed us with all of His grace
Where I'm from,
We're always striving to make it a better place.",country

I used to be so scared of love before you,
Livin' life on my own, so hard to endure.
I thought that love would all just end in heartache, 
Don't have to be scared of it now, all thanks to you.

Gone are all my doubts, I'm finally free.

Your love has opened up my eyes, I don't have to think twice.

But you showed me the truth, that love could never change.
I thought that I'd never find someone to stay, 
But you cherished me, showed me a new way.

Gone are all my doubts, I'm finally free.

The sun was risin high in the Texas sky when I drove my pickup truck out of town
Livin on my own, searchin for a home and a place to lay my weary head down
I spotted an old roadside motel, I needed a bed so I turned off the road
I heard a sweet voice singing in the wind, and I knew I'd never be alone

Singin' yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee

Well I turned off the motor and I rolled down the windows and I listened to her sweet refrain
I had no idea where I was goin', it didn't matter as long as I'd get there someday
She sang of a good ole boy who loved his whiskey and never would give an ounce of pain
And for that on the road that night I knew I'd never be the same

Singin' yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me and Bobby McGee

Well, the years have come and gone, livin' life from town to town
Searchin' for a peace I’d found in that song, but my faith and time had run out
I never found that boy, and I still don't know why, but I'm thankful for his melody
I guess he just wanted to remind us what's worth livin’ and dyin’ for truly

My ol truck is headed down the dusty highway
With the windows wide open and the radio playin'
My heart is filled with longing for what I used to know
Trying to find the courage to let it all go

Headin for Texas, my home away from home
Singing a song of freedom as I'm driftin' along
Longin' for the life that I used to lead
Where I can feel the sunshine and breathe the open air

Chorus:
Freedom's just another word for sweet memories of my past
And no matter how far I roam, those days will always last

Me and Bobby McGee will find the sun again

I'm getting closer to the border, but I'm feeling so alone
My heart is aching, but I'm still standing strong
I'm lookin' for a sweet escape, to find my peace of mind
Where I can leave behind the heartache and find love one more time

Through the tears and sorrow, I'm finding my way
Holdin on to hope that I'll find brighter days
I'm reachin' for the future and learning how to fly
No one can take away my freedom cause it's mine

Can't wait to start over and put the darkness behind
I'm gonna spread my wings and find a brand new day
I'm gonna leave the darkness and find love on the way

Ain't it funny how the times fly by,
I was living it up in '89,
My truck was my home, I had no place to stay,
But I kept the faith and kept on headed my way.

I'm on the road and things keep a changing,
Gettin close to the edge and faith keeps sustaining,
A voice in my heart told me this ain't right,
Gonna hit the gas and leave all this behind.

Chorus:
Take the money and run,
Get away before it all comes undone,
Believe me, in this life you got to move it on,
Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun,
Don't be a fool, trust no one,
You got to take the money and run.

My heart was breakin' but I had to be strong,
The wind it was blowin' but I kept on going on,
There was no use in looking back,
Just keep following my dream, nothing I can't lack.

Though the night be dark and the rain may come,
My faith kept me strong, I kept on going on,
No one else can carry me through,
My dreams will be true, I can make them come true.

So if you find yourself lost in time,
Like I was back in ninety-nine,
You gotta do what you gotta do,
To get away and keep on movin' through.

Sitting in the farmhouse on an old wooden chair,
Ain't much to do but sip my sweet iced tea,
Thinking of the things I wanted and the things I left behind,
And a lesson that I learned from all that time

Take the money and run, Get it at the point of a gun,
Believe it in this town, You can't trust anyone,
You're gonna learn that lesson my son,
Take the money and run, Buy yourself a place in the sun.

I had to thank my Heavenly Father for this second chance,
To start a-over and to give myself a chance,
My bags were packed and my heart was light,
I was headed out of town, and into the night

Take the money and run, Get it at the point of a gun,
Believe it in this town, You can't trust anyone,
You're gonna learn that lesson my son,
Take the money and run, Buy yourself a place in the sun.

The sun never sets in this country sky,
A place I'm proud to call mine,
The gentle summer wind was calling me,
To take the money and run to my happiness and peace of mind.

Take the money and run, Get it at the point of a gun,
Believe it in this town, You can't trust anyone,
You're gonna learn that lesson my son,
Take the money and run, Buy yourself a place in the sun.",country

She had a light heart and a lonesome mess
She held a banjo out of sight
And when she sang it sounded so right
But when she gazed into my eyes

My mama told me stories 'bout far away places
The times she been and how she'd like to go back again
She'd dream of one day being free to fly
But with her family at home it just wasn't the same

I do as I dare, let 'em call me insane
Never sitting on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance with all that I have

Mama used to tell me how her dreams went astray
Telling me how much she wanted to break away
How there was a time when she thought of leaving it all behind
But she chose to put down roots and stay by her side

Desperately he looks for a way out of this nightmare

Them northside angels, they're the sweetest thing you'll ever see
Here comes a lady and there she goes, everybody knows where the wild wind blows
I put a Mississippi pickle in your Brooklyn buns, for free

Beer can stumblin' in the wind, down metropolitan

Woke up this morning with a guitar in my hand,
Strummed the strings and started playin' a band,
Must have been the stars shinin' from above, 
Open up my heart with a song of love, 

Do you feel like I do? 
Do you feel like I do, my friend? 

Had a little party and a shindig on the farm, 
We all gathered 'round just to hear the band, 
The jukebox was dancin' and the fiddles playin', 
Old and young folks all joyfully raisin', 

Do you feel like I do? 
Do you feel like I do, my friend? 

Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no river wide, 
Ain't no two-step that we couldn't ride, 
The campfire was smokin' and the moonshine flowin', 
Stars above, I just got to knowin', 

Do you feel like I do? 
Do you feel like I do, my friend?",country

Verse 1:
We could take a drive up to the mountains,
Kick up some dust in the red dirt air,
Maybe see if we can find a little spot that only we know,
Where we can be alone and free and wild.

So you're saying there's a chance,
Out here beneath the stars,
For two hearts to dance,
And a one in a million shot of finding true romance.

We could jump in the river and do some dancin'
Boot stompin' and clapping our hands,
Staying up late in the summertime,
We'll never look back on these golden days.

Where the farm hands have been toiling all day
Buffalo roams, corn on the cob at their heels
A sight that brings peace to my soul I can say

The sun sets in a blaze of fiery hues
The West Texas sky painted in pastel blues
Crickets are singing and the air smells of hay
Down here in this world of wonders just like today

Soft whispers of wind, like a lullaby
My heart aches with longing, so I just sigh
A glimpse of the stars, shooting by in the night
Take away all my pain, giving me new sight

The night's alive with the howling of coyotes
Serenading each other, their voices in joy
I feel life in my veins, as I raise up my head
To this world of wonders, where I'm filled with dread

The morning brings with it a whole new light
The birds and the bees, the sun shining bright
A feeling of home, of a place that's mine

Like I'm lost in a world of wonders, a world of wonders, a world of wonders

There's a fire in her eyes that still sets my heart aflame

He was the king of the rodeo, a cowboy through and through

The way he moved, the way he spoke, made every heart beat just a little bit faster
The pride and joy of every local town, he always stood tall and proud

He'd pull his hat down low and ride, telling stories of old

He's a honky tonky heavily funky ex-marine. 
He wears the skin tight body builder shirts 
And Jack, he'll knock you out into the dirt. 
But if you don't got no money or you try to get funny, 
Then brother, you're gonna see that man's gonna do the Boogie Woogie and the Hoochie Coochie 
And he'll be doin' all his dancin' on you. 

Chorus 
So if you're lookin' for a good time, 
Look hard as you want, 
But you ain't gonna find any kind of bad times 
You'll find every Friday and Saturday evening 
At the Top Hat Bar and Grill. 

Lookin' for a good time, lookin' for a bad time, 
So if you're lookin' for a good time,

There's a place outside the city, just beyond the county line
Where a quaint little bar sits, and it's known for its good time
You can stroll in any evening, on a Friday or a Saturday
And know that you'll find some fun, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

At the Top Hat Bar and Grill, the music's always loud
Ain't no better body shakin' joint, nowhere to be found
The locals come in droves, they know they'll always get their fill
Of good drinks and good company, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

There's a waitress, she goes by Lil, divorcee, but she ain't no shy lass
Known for her tight hip huggin' pants, and her dancin' class
She can do the boogie woogie, the hoochie and the boogaloo
She'll have you movin' an' groovin' quick, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

And there's a bouncer Gil, he's an ex-marine, he don't mess around
His tight bodysuits, a sight to see, for miles around
He'll keep things peaceful and lively, no matter what happens
And you'll have a good time, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill

If you're lookin' for a good time, look hard as you want
You won't find no better time, spot for your hometown
Every Friday and Saturday night, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
You'll have a mighty fine time, have yourself a real thrill",country

I left my hometown in my pickup truck just to get away
Headin' out to the old west side, to an unknown place
Just when I was 'bout to give up, I heard a distant sound
It was the beat of a cowboy's heart, and the melody of the rodeo
So you better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
The cowboy is comin' to town
He's been herding his cattle all day and night
Gonna find out who's been doin' it right
The cowboy is comin' to town
You can hear the yee haw and see the dust swirl
All sorts of stockings ready to unfurl
The cowboy is comin' to town
You can hear the cowboys singing and feel the campfire heat
Telling stories of trails they've been on, they just can't seem to repeat
You'd better stay on the right side of the law, be kind and be brave
'Cause the cowboy will find out if you've been naughty or nice, you better be sure to behave
So you better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
The cowboy is comin' to town
He's been herding his cattle all day and night
Gonna find out who's been doin' it right
The cowboy is comin' to town
There'll be Texas two-step and a line dance too
Folks celebrating the good life in their boots
The cowboy is comin' to town
Headin' on down to the saloon, welcoming crowds of all kinds
To eat, drink, and be merry, these folks just couldn't be denied
So you better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Verse 1:
I just drove my truck out on the old highway road
With the engine spinnin' like a singing lark in the sky
Headin' for my hometown where I was born and raised
Just to get some peace of mind and some solace by my side

Chorus:
So put on your boots and grab your hat
There's something that I need to know
We're gonna have a time, we're gonna have a jamboree
Cuz Santa Claus is comin' to town

Verse 2:
He's makin' a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's been naughty and who's been nice
Everyone's goin' crazy, you can feel the rhythm and the beat
It's gonna be a fun night for us to move our feet

Chorus:
So get in the mood, put on a show
We're gonna have a Christmas party of our own
We're gonna strum our guitar and yodel down the street
Cuz Santa Claus is comin' to town

Verse 3:
We got 'em Christmas bells and jingle drums
A hot cup of cocoa, with plenty of ice and rum
We'll be dancin' the night away 'til the morning light fades
Then we'll say goodbye to Santa as he disappears in the dawn

Verse 1 
I'm stuck here in this broken cycle, it's hard to feel inspired
My feet don't seem to touch the ground, I'm standing on too much wire
Heartache leads me to you still, always wondering why
It's a treacherous path I'm on, just trying to stay alive

Chorus 
It's a fine line between love and madness, suspense and fear
Sometimes I just can't take it no more, why won't you come near?
Baby its a fine line, don't you hear it knocking on the door?
Why must we keep going round and round, will it ever be more? 

Verse 2
My soul is yearning for something new, a vibrant life to grab
I'm far too much in my own mind, it seems to be a habit
I want something more, something real, a piece of the sky
But alas I'm stuck in this rut, I'm silently asking why

Riding his horse from sun 'till three,
Folks said he was a man of means,

She hops on the saddle and holds on real tight 
She knows every move, every kick and every blow 
She's a saddle bronc girl and she's gonna ride all night

Chorus 
She's a saddle bronc girl, she's one of a kind 
She drives a beat up Chevy, hedge pack and it moves her down the line
Big bronc wind in town just up ahead 
Better hold on tight and tap up just right 
Saddle bronc girl if the glory is in the going 
When she might as well get gone, oh she got no way of knowing 
What kinda bronc she's drawn on the rodeo road she chose 
The warriors way, oh hold on tight and tap up just right 
Saddle bronc girl

And I'ma do my best to make sure we live happily
And you just keep what's left when something happens to me

Take care of me, and bury me

If I broadcast live from deep within me

And I can take her from the hood to the Gucci store

From tank tops and thongs to them Prada pajamas

Motivated by thoughts of empty mouths, nightmares of comin' home to an empty house

Built a castle and watched it collapse in front of me
My daughter, she survived the tragedy, the aftermath of my attempt at a family

Chorus
So don't sit there and talk about what I already know
Or sit there and act as though you would never go
Like you would never ever pack your bags and leave

People take all they can take, and I just run 'em away
Even I can't believe some of the stuff that I say
The holes in the walls can easily be fixed with mud
The holes in us can only be repaired with love
And they can only be mended, they can never be fixed

Holes in the head of a man caught up in the middle of a good thing gone bad

I could never envision you betrayin' me
The one you don't suspect, that's the one it's gon' be
No trust other than my trust in God, 'cause everyone I ever trusted has broke my heart

Pack of dogs at my feet, as I work in the sun
Came into this world on summer days of heat
Grass-stained knees and an unwavering beat

Smell of fresh cut hay, as the sun goes down
Fried chicken in the kitchen and a big pot of stew

Your mama says keep away, your daddy's just not sure
There's something 'bout this town that don't sit right with her
I come around to the country and I hear the train's last call
It's like a siren's song, luring me one and all

So I ride with the wind, just trying to find a way
To get away from all the worries of my day
And the sun sets so pretty, painting the sky into night
Gonna keep rolling 'til I see the morning light

So get out of that old truck and come sit beside me
Leave the city lights behind and be free
We'll take it slow, gonna take it easy
Gonna find a farm and maybe start a family

Cause I'm rolling on, I'm rolling on, just the road and me
Gonna keep rolling on, rolling on, until I'm free
Gonna keep my eyes wide open, for miles and miles ahead
Just rolling on, I'm rolling on, and I ain't gonna look back

So if it's love you want, then I'm ready and willing
To show you what it's like to feel this kind of living
Don't worry about a thing, I'm here for you all day
Your love's a sweet, sweet thing, and I ain't gonna stray

So leave that town behind and come ride with me
We'll go wherever the road takes us and make it what we please
We'll have some fun, and there'll be no more broken dreams
Gonna keep rolling on, until I get what I need

Cause I'm rolling on, I'm rolling on, just the road and me
Gonna keep rolling on, rolling on, until I'm free
Gonna keep my eyes wide open, for miles and miles ahead
Just rolling on, I'm rolling on, and I ain't gonna look back

So don't matter what's said, gotta keep on going
Cause it's my life, and I'm gonna live it like I mean it
And when the sun comes out, I'm gonna greet it with a smile
Gonna keep rolling on, just for a little while

Cause I'm rolling on, I'm rolling on, just the road and me
Gonna keep rolling on, rolling on, until I'm free
Gonna keep my eyes wide open, for miles and miles ahead
Just rolling on, I'm rolling on, and I ain't gonna look back",country

Got that country sound turned up full blast

Fiddlin' and pickin' take her to the stars
Ole time country twang slides through the air
Whiskey, beer and dancing 'til the break of day

Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow, her favorite color is chrome

Too young to know where our lives would be
Living life on the edge, way past curfew
Heading down to that dirt road full of secrets and pure truth

We'd make a U-turn just for kicks
Gripping the wheel like we were Bonnie and Clyde
Crazy love burning up in the air
We'd light up the night sky with nowhere to hide

We were catchin a buzz dodgin the fuzz knowin this time they wouldn't let us slide with a warnin
Couple of kids chasing a dream down a red dirt road on a saturday night 
Wide eyed from a wild ride, stealing another chance just me and my flame

We'd break up and make up, but we always stayed true
Laughing, crying and always fightin' through
Late night drives, nothing but stars above
The neon lights and the moonlight, we felt like we had it all

We were catchin a buzz dodgin the fuzz knowin this time they wouldn't let us slide with a warnin
Couple of kids chasing a dream down a red dirt road on a saturday night

Heather grew up on a farm in the heart of Tennessee
Though she's young, she's still got a few dreams of her own
A long-held dream of a life of a love that could be
So she sets out to find her own destiny

She heads out to the highway, off to make her way
Out of the dust, an old biker said, ""you can make it, gal""
Wind whipin' in her face and the sun getting warm
She knew she'd soon find her true north

Chorus:
It's a love story in the making
Something that was meant to be
A heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny
A sweet love story, that's what she needs

She hears stories of a boy out at Charlie's Bar
Though his looks alone could make any heart swoon
As the night comes alive and the boys start talkin'
Heather watches him keenly across the room

He heads on over, with the devil in his eyes
A voice smooth and deep, like the night
Heather could feel the heat of that night
Little did she know, it was the start of her life

Chorus

Together they'd laugh, they'd fight, but never let go
The love they shared was clear to all who'd seen
Through valleys high, and mountains low
The love of their life, it had just begun

Heather and her man, they sealed their fate
As their hearts intertwined their hands
Now it's a story of a love that was meant to be
Heather and her man, they'll never be apart

A sweet love story, that's what they need",country
"

Sitting at the courthouse side by side young couple hand in hand together for the very first time 
Feeling like a winning hand tears in their eyes as the judge said ""I now pronounce you man and wife"" 
They had their share of heartache and strife pushed through each other facing the stormy night 
It's a love story in the making something that was meant to be a heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny a sweet love story is all they need 

Down the dirt road on their honeymoon driving in an old beat up truck barely made it home 
Just in time to see the stars above in the sky like a sign of their love and when they looked around 
They just knew that was the place to stay never had much but they had each other in the end 
It's a love story in the making something that was meant to be a heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny a sweet love story is all they need 

Like a miracle, dreams came true when they started their family of four 
Four little feet running round the house through the laughter and the tears 
A reminder of what love can do when two people just believe 
It's a love story in the making something that was meant to be a heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny a sweet love story is all they need",country

When the night's gettin' colder, I'm starting to feel lonelier

So I loaded up my truck and drove out here instead.

Came back home to the hills, when my heart could roam no more
Found the peace that I always wanted, got the life I adore
Oh Tennessee River and the mountain breeze
Just like a friend, will never leave me be

Counting my blessings while I’m singing along, happy and wise

Verse 1
I left my home in the Appalachians, I roamed a spell and I then returned
Stopped by the shore of the Tennessee, it was there that my heart it did yearn 
The river ran wild through the mountains and me, just like life had been long before 
But I'd return to the peace of my home, my heart as strong as the mountains I adored

As I returned to my homeland just then, the beauty of it all did astound 
The sun shone down on the horizon, and what I saw there just had me spellbound 
The river ran free between the mountains and me, that's where I found my peace of mind 
So, I stayed there and I called it my home, and my heart was alive for the very first time

Up from the depths of my soul it brings peace, and I know I will never be done

So, thank you Tennessee for giving me the strength, that we can now all call our home

I got out and I saw her in the spotlight 
She was dancin' to the music and it felt so right
I was feelin' the vibe and I knew this night

We moved together like we'd been doin' it for years

Pushing it further than everybody else our age,
Little sparks in the darkness, a wild desire,
Rolling down the highway, searching for what it is we desire.

Rumbled down the dirt road, oh, how we all felt so strong
Crossing rivers, dodging fences, a rebel heart was free
And nothing on earth could take away our days of thunder

Traditions run deep, down in these here parts, the rumble of a diesel truck
Young and wild and running free, searchin' for something more
No rules, no limits, just hearts and dreams for what was in store

Friday night I let her go, she just smiled and said goodbye

When it comes to those tears that tear me apart
When it comes to trying to find my way back home

With the hammer down, I'm all or nothing

I'm driving through the desert heat, looking for a place to rest my feet
I need a place to lay my head, with me and my thoughts instead
Memories from the east coast flood my head, the roads just stretch on ahead
I can't believe I've come this far, trying to make it to Cali's star

In my rearview I saw the sunrise, desert air was on the rise
Dusty roads, some tumbleweeds, beneath the dark blue sky I'd plead
I think about the miles I got left, will I find someone I can keep
I know I've got a long way to go, from Maine to Mexico

This long ride I know it's true, feeling like I'm missing you
It's gonna be so hard to be apart, I'll be missing your beating heart
I hit the road in search of change, it's a lonely life I'm tryin' to maintain
I'll keep looking for the light, the miles just keep on coming tonight

I'm still driving through the desert heat, looking for a place to rest my feet
I need a place to lay my head, with me and my thoughts instead
I said goodbye to the east coast and all of the pain it had exposed
And now I'm riding 'cross the stars, trying to make it to Cali's bar

And now I go from Maine to Mexico by thumb and car and train
I'll be missing you again, in spite of all my worries and my pain
Long nights, long roads, and all the miles between
Still my love for you is stronger than any dream
And now I go from Maine to Mexico by thumb and car and train

By thumb, car, and train, I'll be missing you again

When I think back, I can't help but feel blue, it hurt me so

Her father had been found face down in the cold
Walked her way around the hill, with the sun shining down
On a blanket of snow

Smoke at the coast, and oh

Let your minds drift on down, like so, to when the world was young

Spin around, what a life to have known
What a time and how I was singing out in the crowd

Finally went out, what a fright we felt in that night

Riding down a road that was out of luck.

His body still and his eyes so bare.

Left us alone in the dawn.

No one can see his face, so oddly.
Silently the waves start to crash,

A reminder that in life nothing sticks around.
Our tears then turned to sorrow,
Fearing everything we'd borrowed.
The birds singing in the sky,
A sad song for the goodbyes.

The wind through my hair and the sun on my face,

The kind of freedom I never want to fail.

Singin' a song that made me stop and listen,
She sang of countin' flowers on the wall,
Reminding me of my own days of fall.

So I'm countin' flowers on the wall,
Letting that old time feeling take its toll,
Playin' solitaire till the morn,
With a deck of fifty-one, a-watchin' Captain Kangaroo.

The road can be calling and I know I must go,
But I'll come back here and I'll lay here low,
Cause there's no better place to be,

I keep chasin' the wind around,
Ridin' horses and singin' the sound,
It's the freedom that always has me enthralled,
Where I can just be and never feel small.

Verse 1
We rode together up to Nashville town
The wind was singing our favorite tune
The wheels kept spinning and the dust flew up
It’s time to spread our wings and take off on our own

Chorus 
I’m gonna miss you, yes I will
Forever in my heart, you’ll stay still
My life is my conscience, the seeds I sow
I just wanted to let you know

Verse 2
We said goodbye and you went your way
The tears rolling down our faces that day
We hugged one last time, and said goodbye
Our paths had changed, but our love stayed alive

Forever in my heart, you’ll stay still
My life is my conscience, the seeds I sow

Lost my way from the straight and narrow winding
Dreams of the past, fading away like a spark

Grandma's Farm House a Song for Grandpa
Verse 1
Grandpa used to tell me stories, of his days growing up out on the farm
He'd take me out to Grandma's house, showing me around and on his arm
The barn was falling down, but his spirit in that place still stands
The sunset in the sky, never failed to take my breath away

Chorus
Grandpa built that farm house, strong and steady with his hands
He worked so hard to make it last, noble man of the land
He shared his love with us, with each and every day
Grandpa's farm house will remain, for generations to stay

Verse 2
He had a laugh that rumbled the porch, and a heart made of pure gold
He and Grandma shared a bond so strong, that never could get old
He taught us all about hard work, and the importance of life's truths
He lived for the music of the birds, and the rustle of the noontime breeze

Chorus
Grandpa built that farm house, strong and steady with his hands
He worked so hard to make it last, noble man of the land
He shared his love with us, with each and every day
Grandpa's farm house will remain, for generations to stay

Bridge
Before he left us, he said goodbye, like he had something he wanted to show
But he knew in his heart was knowledge, the greatest love of all

Grandma's Apple Pie

Grandma rolled out dough in her apron so neat,
Workin' hard 'til she got a pile of sweet treats
Fillin' up the crust with apples from the trees
Taste of cinnamon and the smell of honeybees 

Chorus

Grandma's bakin' up her apple pie,
Warmth of love with every bite we try
Gather 'round the table, pass the plate around
It's Grandma's apple pie, the best that can be found 

Grandpa said to my Pa, ""Boy, you ain't seen nothin'""
Took us out to the orchard just to start somethin'
Ladder leaned ag'inst the tree with a summer breeze
Scared the birds away with his ole rusty keys

Chorus

Grandma cracked the eggs and said, ""Come and see""
Cream and sugar in the bowl with sweetness and glee
Mixin' in the apples, it smelled so good
We knew Grandma was bakin' up somethin' that we could

Chorus

Grandma brought out the pies, golden brown and steamin'
Underneath the crust, all the apples were beamin'
We smiled in delight, just like it was a dream
Grandma's apple pie, that was the BEST we ever seen 

Chorus 

Grandpa was a carpenter he built houses stores and banks
Chain smoked Camel cigarettes and hammered in planks
He was level on the level and shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower cause Lincoln won the war",country

Nine Black Horses brave the wind, without a trace of fear,
Ridin' right ahead with courage and a will to persevere,
Their manes and tails are flyin' wild, they're barely hangin' on,
Nine Black Horses face the storm and carryin' us along.

Nine White Horses in the night, travelin' 'cross the sky,
Glowin' bright so all can see, they have a steady eye,
Their manes and tails glimmer white, they're never far behind,
Nine White Horses keep the pace, so we all can reach the line.

Take the reins and head towards the sunrise,
Feed the fire and push the boundaries,
The devil take your soul, and grace you with a humble heart,
Temptation is the breaker of a man, you must follow your own part.

Nine Black Horses as the night slowly falls,
Shadows creep, but strength within them calls,
Their manes and tails are full of pride, they know what needs to be done,
Nine Black Horses break the ice 'til the morning comes.

Nine White Horses lead the way, 'cross the rocky trail,
Righteous spirits within them keep them never fail,
Their manes and tails glow bright, they don't need a coat of paint,
Nine White Horses they can lead us through a storm and keep us sane.

Take the reins and head towards the sunrise,
Feed the fire and push the boundaries,
The devil take your soul, and grace you with a humble heart,

Pick your side saddle up and ride.",country

I can't stand the thought of him being taken away
So I'm begging to you, friend, don't take him

He's the fire when I'm feeling so cold
He's the stars in the sky, when I come back home
He's a four-leaf clover and a lucky stone
He's my sunshine, he's my all-time

He's my life, he's my love, he's all I need and more
He's my future and my dreams, and I'm sure
He's the love that comforts me when I'm feeling low
He's my best friend, he's my only one",country

If I had gone a different way and taken life's detours
I'd be a man full of joy and I'd never feel remorse
I'd travel to the mountain tops and down to the shore
Just to learn the lessons that I'd never heard before

If I were young again I'd take the time to explore
Every corner of this world and all that it has in store
Riding with the wind, or sailing on a ship
Searching far and wide, and never take a slight

Cause in life you get one chance and you better take it slow
Choose the right roads and you will never feel low
No matter what comes, no matter how things may be
For better or worse, I know I'd still be free

And I've been left for dead before, but I still fight on
I won't let the world defeat me and I'll keep rolling on
Dancing to the beat of the music inside my soul
Pain and sorrow will have no hold

And I'd learn to live and love, and take each day as it comes
Cherish every moment, and never forget the ones
My life is a journey, and sometimes it's been hard
But never will I give up, and I'll go on guard

So don't wait up and leave the light on
I'll be home soon, don't worry 'bout me
No matter what comes, I will never be gone
I'll still keep fighting, for a life that’s strong",country

Verse 1
She grew up proud and simple in a small country town
The fiddle was a-playin the callin never died down
Folks'd gather 'round the porch and onto the wooden floor
When the strings of the guitar sang a sweet country score

Chorus
Singin' Sweet Rose of Sharon, abide with me
Ride the gospel ship to Heaven's jubilee
And in that great triumphant mornin' my soul will be free
My burdens will be lifted when my Savior's face I see

Verse 2
My Mama sang with fervor Jimmie Rodgers and The Carters
Old gospel records on the phonograph were always her fodder
She'd gaze upon the stars, with dreams of singing in The Grand Ol' Opry
My heart sang with pride that she'd seek something higher than me

Chorus
Singin' Sweet Rose of Sharon, abide with me
Ride the gospel ship to Heaven's jubilee
And in that great triumphant mornin' my soul will be free
My burdens will be lifted when my Savior's face I see

When I go back to visit in my home sweet home
I'm greeted with memories of the music she once known
And though time has passed, Lord, I still feel her mark on me
The Opry of my Mama is where I always long to be

Singin' Sweet Rose of Sharon, abide with me
Ride the gospel ship to Heaven's jubilee
And in that great triumphant mornin' my soul will be free
My burdens will be lifted when my Savior's face I see

She grew up in a small town where the honky tonks abound

Chorus

Til I take the gospel train to Heaven's Jubilee
When in that glorious morning my soul will be free
There's nothing on this earth like the sound of my Mama's ol' Opry

Verse 2
She turned up the old gospel records and sang along with glee
Singing those songs of faith, like it was the Grand Ol' Opry
At night when she hung the laundry, I'd listen for hours and be
Captivated by her spirit, singing tones of sweet harmony

While the years have come and gone, I still remember that song 
Of faith, of hope, of love, and the blessing that was shared so freely

That I'm never truly alone, while I'm singing in the Grand Ol' Opry

Wearing my cowboy hat and boots that you thought went out of style long time ago.

When I heard that steel guitar moan
And everybody sang along but no one noticed Hank in his cowboy hat and boots
Everybodys eyes for George, except for a country preacher named Reverend Scott
Father Scott got down on his knees and prayed for the souls of everybody in that church
Hank just said, ""No need for worry, ain't no judgement here tonight""

The stars twinkle and the wind blew cold

Never knew a man could make music just with the turn of a phrase

Trying not to show how much my heart was broken, just like my Father's words

He worked day and night, practicin' the chords, hoping one day he'd make it far
He would write his songs while the rest of the world slept, dreamin' of the places he'd go
He said, ""I'm gonna take this guitar and give everything I got, gonna get it right, and hit the road""

From the lost and forgotten, to money and acclaim
He just stepped into the spotlight, and the light wasn't dim

He lived the rockstar life, n' sell out show after show
But if you asked him now he'd say it all came with a price and he's ready to go

But all I found was tears, left in the dust of the air

Chorus:
What a feeling, living with no one to call my own
Don't wanna believe this is how the story ends
I was just another sunset, fading in your eyes
I may never love another, like my girl of the summer

Bridge:
Never knew that you'd be gone, never got to say goodbye
I can still see your silhouette under the summer sky
And I'll keep searching for you, hoping that you're still out there
Dreaming of returning to that place, where I lost you to the night

What a feeling, living with no one to call my own
Don't wanna believe this is how the story ends

Gone as quick as the wind, like an eclipse
Them little moments were like a dream
But I can never go back and so it seems

I may never love another like my girl of the summertime
I was just another sunset fading in your eyes

I remember when I had you in my arms
Your voice like a melody, so divine and so warm
The days were so long and the skies so clear
But now all I have are broken dreams and only tears

Chorus
I was just another sunset fading in your eyes
I may never love another like my girl of the summertime
I was just another sunset fading in your eyes
I may never love another like my girl of the summer

Verse 3
I walk alone down memory lane every single day
Wondering where the time has gone, oh why did you go away?
It's like you left without a trace, no footprint in the sand
So now I'm here wondering if I'll ever understand

I may never love another like my girl of the summertime

I grew up in the heart of Tennessee
Had an old guitar, small city dreams
I heard stories of places I would like to see
Like the Gulf of Mexico, wild and free

Chorus:
Running wild, living free, away from all that life can be
Singin' songs, living life, just me and Bobby McGee

I packed up my bags and said goodbye
Had a one way ticket, lookin' to the sky
On the way down to Mobile, I heard a song on the radio
The words said it all, I was livin' on the go

Chorus

My feet touched down in Louisiana
Lonely roads and so much to see
The music kept me goin', the wind in my hair
I knew I was bound for a place that no one could compare

Chorus

I sang all day, I sang all night
Till my voice got dry and my heart felt light
Those days are gone, but I still feel the beat
Livin' like I'm free, living like Bobby McGee

I'm rolling down the road in my rusty ol truck 
Took a wrong turn and I'm running out of luck 
I'm headed to Dixie just to feel alive 
Wind in my hair and my heart open wide 

There's something 'bout the south that I just can't deny 
Looking for a second chance, just one more try 
Time to shake off the dust and find another way 
Close my eyes and let the music take me away 

Chorus:
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose 
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, with the rhythm of the blues 
And that good enough, yeah, enough for me 

I found myself a job down at a local farm 
Grew up in the city, but this place is my home 
Earning my keep, no use in complainin' 
The sun's on my face and I'm right where I'm meant to be 

I'm living to the fullest with every ounce of love 
Never gonna forget, just how good it was 
The life of my own, ain't no one to tell me no 
Put my faith in the sky, I'm ready to go

Take it one day at a time, never lookin' behind

Lovin' life under the southern skies

Sittin' on My Porch in Tennessee
Verse 1
I swapped my city shoes for boots way down in Tennessee
The hills have welcomed me, the air is sweeter here, can you see?
My old guitar sits on my porch, I strum it every day
I try to follow what's inside and in my heart I do pray

It's a sad tale, of a widow wife
Living in Harper Valley, Tennessee
Raised her daughter, to be strong and brave
But never in her wildest dreams

Did she think that one day, she would be
Slapped in the face by the Harper Valley PTA
They said her dress was too high
That she was drinkin' and runnin' round
Mama fought back and she just had to say

But what of your own guilty stains
Take a look in the mirror round here
And you'll see a picture of pure fear

But real life don't come with a script
We all gotta stand, when accused so wrong

Aint too many things that I don't know round these parts

I was just a small town girl, so young and so naive 
An apple off of the tree, ready to take a bite and see
I left that orchard, it was time to roam
And followed the river to a different home
I joined the movement, were dreams were free to follow
But soon I'd find, that I was too shallow

To dive into the deep, where the river flow so strong
I'd cross the bridge, but I hadn't crossed it for so long
There's a creek I used to go, where I'd spend all my days
It runs so deep, but the feelings fade

The memories of you on that hollow log, I carry with me still
The hope I felt that day, made my heart stand so still
I married that spring, just after we met
But I'm still here and you are long gone yet

I got the Dog River blues, I've worn holes in both my shoes
I still got the river, but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues, I've worn holes in both my shoes
I still got the river, but I ain't got you

The rain came down, and the river had risen up
It flooded my home, and I wanted to give up
But I stayed strong and I looked to the stars
I'm still here, and the river still runs so far

I got the Dog River blues, I've worn holes in both my shoes
I still got the river, but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues, I've worn holes in both my shoes
I still got the river, but I ain't got you

My heart still yearns, and the river still rolls
I pray someday, it will bring you home
If you change your mind, honey I'll be here waiting
On the banks of that old Dog River

I got the Dog River blues, I've worn holes in both my shoes
I still got the river, but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues, I've worn holes in both my shoes
I still got the river, but I ain't got you",country

My heart's so heavy, my mind so low
Ain't no lovin' left and no place to go
I miss the one I once yearned for
And the love we shared on that Hollow Log

Oh, I'm left here all alone
Feeling like the River's flowing on 
I lost the one I love and now I'm bound 
To the Dog River Blues that I can't outrun

The rain it comes, the river it flows 
It's all I can do not to follow it's slow  
And all the pretty things we vowed to do 
Seem further away with each passing view

Well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
Oh if you change your mind, Honey, I'll be here
Waiting on the banks of that old Dog River

I got the Dog River Blues, I'm walking holes in both my shoes

Living in a small town, nothing ever changed 
Though the old machine used to run it all 
She's been here so long, she's here all alone 
Sweeping up the glitter, pulling all the strings

Take a long look, before she turns to stone 
What the last man took, the pain that lingers on 
I wasn't there to see it working properly 
It's too late now, for any sympathy

Chorus
In a razor town you take whoever you think you can keep around
There's an echoed sound that permeates the sidewalks where she shuffles round
It's a big machine and it used to spit out dreams, now it just brings you down
Take a long last look before she turns to stone

Verse 2
What the last man took and what was long long gone, the way it used to be
I wasn't there to see it working properly, a life so hard to flee

So say your last goodbye, make it short and sweet

Chorus
Well, I left my home in Norfolk Virginia 
California on my mind 
Straddled that greyhound and rode it all over the place 
Headin' out West, and I'm never looking back 

Verse 1
I crossed the Mississippi, steady 'cross the middle 
Went all the way through Alabama, and gave 'em a diddle 
Then I hit some motor trouble, it sure was a jungle 
But I had my through train ticket, would take me straight through Louisiana

Chorus
Well, I left my home in Norfolk Virginia 
California on my mind 
Straddled that greyhound and rode it all over the place 
Headin' out West, and I'm never looking back 

Verse 2
Bought me a silk suit, had luggage in my hands 
Once I hit Albuquerque, the sky was my land 
On a jet I was flying, all the way to the Golden State 
Proclaimed to be the promised land, for all of us up to date

Chorus
Well, I left my home in Norfolk Virginia 
California on my mind 
Straddled that greyhound and rode it all over the place 
Headin' out West, and I'm never looking back 

Verse 3
I called all my friends, told 'em I made it to the promised land 
All these people out here, they understand 
So here I stand, California in my hands 
I'm gonna make it my home, no matter what they had planned 

Chorus
Well, I left my home in Norfolk Virginia

Verse 1:
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, headed for the ocean's side
California on my mind, I packed up my things and I took a ride 
Straddled that greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh, and on across Caroline 
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill, never was a minute late 

Chorus:
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown, rolling across the Georgia state 
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle, halfway across Alabam 
The hound broke down, left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham 
Straight off bought me a through-train ticket, right across Mississippi clean 

Verse 2:
Headed for the Lincoln Nebraska sky, I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham 
Smoking into New Orleans, somebody help me get out of Louisiana 
Just help me get to Houston Town, there's people there who care a little about me 
They won't let the poor boy down, sure as you're born

Chorus:
They bought me a silk suit, put luggage in my hands 
Woke up high over Albuquerque, on a jet to the promised land 
Working on a T-Bone steak a la carte, flying over to the golden state 
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes, we'd be heading in the terminal gate 

Outro:
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy 
Taxi to the terminal zone, cut your engines cool your wings 
And let me make it to the telephone 
Los Angeles gives me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater four-ten-oh-nine 
Tell the folks back home, this is the promised land calling

Wandered far away from the one I love,
Tryin' to find some peace of mind.
Till I found out how much I had to give,
I was so far behind.

Chorus 
It takes a dreamer to get this far,
A real believer when the darkness falls.
It takes a fool to let a good life fall apart,
It takes a woman for a man to make it in this life.

Lived in the shadows of my own regret,
So many miles from home.
Realized that I had to find a way,
So I could find some hope.

Without someone to hold, it's hard to feel the victory of defeat
Climb higher than you've ever gone

The sun came up like a beacon this morning long about seven o'clock
Casting a light in my broken heart just like a thousand jagged rocks
I tried so hard to keep it together but the tears ran down my face
My heart was filled with such emotion that it was an empty space

It got lonely too early this morning, when love just couldn't stay
It took a part of my heart with it that I can't replace
I still feel it in the air when I hear his name
It got lonely too early this morning before I was ready to take the blame

I wanna be with someone who won't leave when times get tough
I need a love that won't go cold and will still be there when I'm feeling rough
I'm sure I'll find someone who's right for me, I just have to search a while
'Cause it got lonely too early this morning, long before I saw his smile

Got lonely too early this morning
That old heartache was achin'

Without seeing the way things used to be
Memories are haunting me now
It's gonna be a long night, I can see

I swore I'd never leave the place where I'd grown up so proud

And I won't be jonesin for his loving anymore
Cause I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago

Verse 1:
I'm just a working man, with nine kids and a wife
Been workin' hard all my life, it's been a struggle for sure
I'm gonna keep at it, so long as I have two hands to use
I'll drink my beer alone and sing my working man blues

Chorus:
These are the working man blues, working day and night
Eatin' easy on a Saturday, but always back to the grind on Monday morning light
Gotta do what I gotta do, gonna keep myself a-rising
I'm gonna sing this song of mine, a tribute to the working man

Verse 2:
Sometimes I feel like walking away and try bummin' around
But I know I can't do that, there's just no way to be found
So I'll keep on working, gotta buy my kids new shoes
I'll stop by the tavern, cry a little to the working man blues

Chorus:
These are the working man blues, working day and night
Eatin' easy on a Saturday, but always back to the grind on Monday morning light
Gotta do what I gotta do, gonna keep myself a-rising
I'm gonna sing this song of mine, a tribute to the working man

Bridge:
It's a hard livin' life, but I'm trying my best
Got a family to feed, that's why I'm in this mess
I ain't never been on welfare and that's one place I won't be
Gonna keep on singing 'till I'm done, the working man's song for me

Chorus:
These are the working man blues, working day and night
Eatin' easy on a Saturday, but always back to the grind on Monday morning light
Gonna do what I gotta do, gonna keep myself a-rising

Verse 1
Ain't nothin' 'bout life easy livin' down on these hardscrabble plains
There's stormclouds on the horizon, more bills than my paycheck can contain
Still I'll keep on laboring, puttin' in the daily dues
I take my solace in a bottle of beer and singin' these working man blues

Chorus
Here comes the working man, hey-hey, the working man, the working man like me
I won't never be on welfare, that's one place I won't be
Cause I'll be workin' as long as these two hands are fit to use
I'll take my comfort in a bottle of beer and singin' these working man blues

Verse 2
Gonna put in another hard day's work, never gonna take a break
I ain't too tired or worn out, 'cause I'm tougher than the toughest stake
Though I may get a little lonely when I'm so far from home
I pull up another chair, order up a beer, and keep on singin' my working man blues

Chorus
Here comes the working man, hey-hey, the working man, the working man like me
I won't never be on welfare, that's one place I won't be

I'll take my comfort in a bottle of beer and singin' these working man blues

Bridge
Lord, I'm puttin' in my time, thinkin' 'bout some getaway
But I gotta face hard truth, I'm better off just workin' away
So I'll keep on laboring, my burden supported by booze
'Til I'm too tired to sing, I'll still be singin' my working man blues

Chorus
Here comes the working man, hey-hey, the working man, the working man like me

Verse 1: 
I remember how my Daddy used to sing his old country tunes
About the preacher man who lost the love of his life so soon
It gave me comfort as he tucked me in and sang of days gone by
His gentle voice like an old guitar, his melodies fill the sky

Chorus:
And in my heart I miss him still, I drift away in the melody
And dream of him, his broken heart, and his plea to have her one more day
His song of love echoes in my mind, it follows me through all my days
And I can recall his words of love as I drift off to a sweet slumber

Verse 2:
I grew up and went out on my own, a wild teen with stars in my eyes
My Daddy tried but I’d barely stay and say ‘goodnight’
But he never knew that when I closed my eyes, and turned out the light
I’m warmed by the melodies of his songs, it fills my heart with delight 

Chorus:
And in my heart I miss him still, I drift away in the melody
And dream of him, his broken heart, and his plea to have her one more day
His song of love echoes in my mind, it follows me through all my days
And I can recall his words of love as I drift off to a sweet slumber",country
"

Verse 1:
I hear the same old stories 'bout a broken heart and pain
That preacher man who lost his wife, the love that he did gain
That guitar played melodies, I'd hang on every word
All those dreams, my fondest memories I heard when I was young

Chorus:
Please come back to me, we'll build this spring and start a family
One more day is all I need, so much I want to say
Don't leave me this way, can't bear to see you go
Oh the live's in my fondest memories of you singing

Verse 2:
I remember growing up like a weed through my teenage years
My daddy tried to show me love, but I was just to cool
I'd hide my feelings from the world, couldn't show how much I cared
But when I closed my eyes I'd hear his song and silently I'd share

Chorus:
Please come back to me, we'll build this spring and start a family
One more day is all I need, so much I want to say
Don't leave me this way, can't bear to see you go

My heart's playing a song it just won't let go
It's hard to resist this feeling I'm missing so
It's like I'm caught in my ever spinning wheel
This love I've got for you, It just won't let me be

Chorus

You've got my heart, skipping, skippin' a beat
Run the needle through, hit, hit repeat

And then when it's to the end I gotta play it again, and again

Verse 2
My friends they just laugh and tell me it's a shame
My head's in the clouds and I'm in utter pain

Got a bright white smile and a taste for some dreams
Got that country swagger and an attitude that's rude

Chrome saddlin up on a horse of white
Diamond spurs hangin' off her boots tonight
Ridin' off to the honky-tonk without a second thought

Gonna ride 'til the leathers too hard to bear

Lipstick, rhinestones, and an unbroken stride

Hello Country Town, Long time No See 
It's been a while since I've been around 
But I can feel your livin' warmth in the air 
And I know it's just what I need here and now 

So I'm gonna put on my cowboy hat 
And head out on the town, yeah that's a fact 
I'm gonna find a place to relax and unwind 
Where the livin' is easy and the beer is always cold 

So hello country town, long time no see

Let my worries float away, take a load off my mind 
Goodbye city life, hello Country Town tonight

We'll two-step 'til the break of day 
Gonna take a spin around this here dance floor 
And I just might find my way

So hello country town, long time no see 
Never knew this small town could be so sweet 
Let my worries float away, take a load off my mind 
Goodbye city life, hello Country Town tonight

A sweet and sad country song 
Reminds me of those whiskey days

Just drove into the town, so pleased to see the scene

I heard the music play and knew I took the same road again

Hello honky tonk, so glad we're here again
Never knew that jukebox could sing its sweet refrain
The neon lights ain't ever been so brightly lit
And from the loneliness I'm ready to make my quick exit

Verse 2
I left my sorrows at home, but haven't left my blues
So I guess an old song will help me drink my way through
And I walk up to the bar like I ain't got a care
Cos I'm here to let go of all the things I wanna forget

Verse 1
I'm just a man with my hands on the wheel
And nothing to show for my time and my years
I've worked so hard, struggled to make ends meet
But all I got was a pocket full of sympathy

Chorus 
How can a man feel anything when all he ever got was sympathy
Take both your hands and put them round my neck
You're a fool for wanting everything, couldn't be much fun being a millionaire

Verse 2
To one, a million's just a million of one thing
Cutting to the chase, I suppose there'd be a day
When all my tired hands will be put to shame
I've got a restless old woman standing by my side

Chorus
She can't wait for the finer things in life
She waited all this time so I suppose she has the right
But I drank away all the things I could provide
All of that aside, I never meant to make her cry

Bridge
But crying is just the baby inside
The ones that mess around, that tend to fuss and bring us down
Tugging at your lips to make you frown
So my grandson will be living with a chip on his shoulder
And God don't listen to his prayers anymore
I hope he understands when he's a little bit older
That I always wished the best for him

Sing it 'til I'm far away from here
If this can be my chance to feel it once in my life
Then sing it brother 'cause I don't even care",country

When all he ever got was sympathy

Going in circles, running out of time

I been livin' in this end of town, where I don't know nobody's name

The sun is setting on the hills, I ain't got nobody else,
I'm feeling lonesome and forlorn, like I'm just about to wither and melt
No shoes on my feet, no hat on my head, none of them can make me feel complete
So I grab my old guitar and strum with my heart to make the morning sun arise

Holding me close keep me safe in its arms,
The music between our strings, it gives me back my wings,
And it takes me away on its song, so far away.

From nightfall 'til the morning light, it's been my compan'ion so long

Even when the sun doesn't shine, these melodies will set me free

Verse 1:
Down the dusty trail I go, ready to start a brand new show
Can't wait to get to where I know, over at the border
Burdens I'm carrying all around, here I come no time to slow down
My heart is beating to that old sound, waiting at the border

Chorus:
Monday morning, Monday morning, my destiny's waiting for me
I'm picking up, I'm running away to the place I want to be
Where those dirty people can't take what's mine, no they can never follow me
The freedom I'll find is a life divine, when I get to the border

Verse 2:
My old life I'll soon forget, 'cause I ain't coming back here yet
Leave my worries with no regret, when I get to the border
Cross the line and shed my fears, a new life and new tomorrow's near
Happiness is why I'm here, when I get to the border

Packin' up my gear for a trip around the bend
Heading down to Texas, ain't nothing like my friends
Lone Star State of Mind, just can't seem to get away
Cause Texas is my home and I'm gonna stay

I'm headed for the honkytonks and the rodeo shows
The chili and the barbecue, the music and the flow
Of old time stories they been passed down through the years
Of cowboys, outlaws, and a whole lot of beers

That Texas way of life is truly divine
My heart just starts to sing when I'm soaking up that sunshine
There ain't no other place on this earth I'm a-yearning for
It's just something 'bout that heat that I can't ignore

I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather
I crave the smell of good old saddle leather
I've got Texas in my heart

I've been lookin' for the peace my soul seeks in Texas
Where I can gather around with good friends and family
Where I can take my time, no need to rush around
Cause I know it's there I'm gonna settle down

So I'll keep on packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather

I'm feelin' mighty fine to head on down to the bayou jubilee
From Acadia parish tonight we'll travel with a jubilant glee
Bring your partner, bring your blues and pick up a cold one on the way
We'll dance to the music fiddle and guitar and drums that play

Down at the dance they'll yell and they'll hoot and they'll holler all night
The old-timers play their tunes 'til the morning light
When the sun comes up they crank up the heat again
It's like a fever that won't ever end

Round in circles, hold your partner tight
In their arms you'll feel so right
As the party carries on until it's time to go
We'll never forget the sound of the bayou jubilee

From soybeans to sugar cane to crawfish and jambalaya
We'll make the bayou rock with the songs we'll play
That accordion is just a-hummin' along
Throw your hands together and join in the song

Oh, grab your baby and dance 'til three
Listen to the music of the bayou jubilee
C'mon, dancin' feet, won't you take your chance

Ain't no better way to drown the sorrows of today
Than to head to my favorite dive, for a bender 'till I'm saved
On my bar stool sittin' thinking 'bout the way things used to be
Till from the jukebox I heard a Classic Country song, singing out to me

I'm gonna wait here and chill out for a minute
Till somebody takes me home

Verse 2
Texan whisky and cold beer, must have been a mighty sight
A Saturday night full of the sweetest honky-tonk delight
I looked around and saw nothing but the people I know
Then one of 'em said follow me, and we'll all end up on a road

I find myself in places I never thought I'd be,
Wishin' I could take back some of the things I said to me.
My thoughts are in a jumble, tryin' to make some sense,
Of the pieces I'm pickin up, with no repairs in sight or expense.

From the endless dream I'm living in, time after time.

Goodbye dry eyes, I've watched your plain feet
Wander off West to the moon
It felt so strange to walk away alone, no regrets, no tears goodbye
Don't want you back, we'd only cry again, say goodbye again

Chorus:
Our weeks, they turned to days
The days they turned to years
We used to laugh and sing and find the time to dance and cheer
But with you gone, my heart is still aching
As I say goodbye to all we've shared
I don't know how I can go on living
Without the love we used to share

The hours that were ours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I awoke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone
Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghost away
Just beyond the darkest hour, just behind the dawn
It feels so strange to leave my life alone

My love so strong I just can't fight,
My heart so full I could not speak,

The times we whispered, ""I love you so.""

Now I'm alone and I can see,
That without you, I just can't be.

The life we had or might have seen,
The times we laughed, the times we cried,
But now all I have are memories of you and I.

This girl here's been around town
She's been searching for true love, up and down
But I don't think so, I don't think so 
The cowboy there, he looks so tough
He's been sweet-talkin' her enough
But I don't think so, I don't think so

Faded jeans and two-step trains 
Sweet nothings whispered in her ear

And she closes her eyes and she kisses that frog each time 
Finding the more boys she meets the more she loves her dog 
He comes along, with a guitar and a song
And he swears he's the one, but oh she knows it's all wrong 
But I don't think so, I don't think so

Bonfires burning out in the sand 
Living for the moments when the stars align

There's a howl on the prairie, it's wild and it's free
Rising up from the sagebrush, spirit in the breeze
It's the song of the coyote searching for his home
In the pathway of eternity he wanders alone
In the pathway of eternity he wanders alone

There's a call from the canyons, echoing down in the night
In a land so untamed, a spirit of flight
It's a voice of the hawk, like a whisper on the wind
Crying out for freedom in the wilderness
Crying out for freedom in the wilderness

Whoa eternity bound,
Once we've passed into the timeless, never more be found
Is there anybody listening? Can you hear the sound
Of the wild ones, eternity bound, of the wild ones, eternity bound

There's a cry from the mountains, it's high and it's strong
Ringing out from the peaks, where the rainbow rides on
It's the song of the eagle, far and wide he's known
A symbol of freedom, in eternity he soars alone
A symbol of freedom, in eternity he soars alone

Whoa eternity bound,
Once we've passed into the timeless, never more be found
Is there anybody listening? Can you hear the sound
Of the brave ones, eternity bound, of the brave ones, eternity bound

Whoa eternity bound,
Once we've passed into the timeless, never more be found
Is there anybody listening? Can you hear the sound
Of the free ones, eternity bound, of the free ones, eternity bound",country

Where the wind blows cold, but the heart stays warm.
A lonesome holler, no one around,
As I start a song of forgotten sound.

To the darkness of my past.

Dust kicks up beneath the stirrups.

Verse 1
My truck is hitched, I'm packin' up for another drive 
I'm takin' my time, hopin' to find some peace of mind 
I'm past the point of no return, cuttin' every corner and turn 
Leavin' behind the heartache that I'll never unlearn 

Chorus
And I do it again and again, I listen for visions and missions in the wind 
I won every battle and lost the war 
You dared me to reach for it, you dared me to know 
So I drove that car just as slow as it would go
Listening for the sound of my last hope

Verse 2
Just a man against the world, tryin' to right what's wrong 
Followin' my fate, down an uncertain path for so long 
Through the broken hearts and the lies, tryin' to make 'em understand why 
Ain't no use tryin' to explain 'cause they don't see the same

Chorus
And I do it again and again, I listen for visions and missions in the wind 
I won every battle and lost the war 
You managed to take more than I had, with your greedy treaties and your rubber badge 
You may have won every battle but you lost the war

Verse 3
It's a matter of commitment, a matter of fate 
Not a life for the chosen, toil for those who ain't brave 
Pickin' up the pieces of what's been left behind 
Gatherin' some strength, hopin' to make another try

Chorus
And I do it again and again, I listen for visions and missions in the wind 
I won every battle and lost the war 
I only did what I knew, simple math nothing more nothing less 
If you hadn't told me I never would have guessed 
How hungry was your hate, how sealed was my fate 
And I won every battle but lost the war

You may have won every battle but lost the war

Tryin' to find my way without any strife,
I do a good job, but it's never enough,
Seems like I'm stuck in a rut, it's kind of rough.

I was drivin' down the highway when the sun set on the field 
A bright star in the sky, I knew it was time to heal 
I said, Lord forgive me for all my foolish ways 
Before I get home and this fight begins, here's what I need to say.

Give me just a one more last chance before you say we're through 
I know I drive you crazy baby, it's the best that I can do 
We're just some good ol' boys, makin' noise, I ain't a-runnin' round on you 
Give me just a one more last chance before you say we're through.

Now I'm sittin' on the porch, stars shinin' in the night 
I see the anger in her eyes, and she's a-ready for a fight 
I take a deep breath, try to explain what I'm feelin' deep inside 
But before I can even start, she turns and walks away with pride.

Give me just a one more last chance before you say we're through 
I know I drive you crazy baby, it's the best that I can do

Give me just a one more last chance before you say we're through.

The morning sun's a-risin' and the dewy grass is wet 
A cool breeze blowin' through, I'm ready to place my bet 
I can't stand to lose her love, I'm in love with every breath 
So I take a deep breath and pray to God, give me just one more chance, before death.

Give me just a one more last chance before you say we're through 
I know I drive you crazy baby, it's the best that I can do

My heartache is strong, but I hear the birds singin'
Singin' a song of comin' home to me

Why don’t we take all the farmers out West,
Lead them up to the old homestead,
Where the land is wide and the sky is clear,
Let nature soothe away their fear.

Let's put the bankers on their horses high,
Show them how to sow and to plow the fields,
Let them learn the lessons that the hardworking men taught,
Of the struggles of their old-time folks.

It's true for you and it's true for me,
You don't need to be smart to see,
The only way to stay ahead,
It takes more than it did back then.

For the little man is getting smaller all of the time,
The little man is getting smaller all of the time.

Why don't we take all the factory jobs,
Let technology fill that void,
Give the workers more time to spend with their families,
Unite in a world free of strife.

Let's turn the tables on the greedy few,
Make them work for their daily bread,
Let them find gainful employment and take pride,
In learning from the little man.

It's true for you and it's true for me,
You don't need to be smart to see,
The only way to stay ahead,
It takes much more than just one man.

For the little man is getting smaller all of the time,
The little man is getting smaller all of the time.

So let's join together in our fight,
For the future of the little man,
Let's bring back some of the old values,
Where everyone has a chance to stand.

Let's not forget the lessons of the past,
Respect the land and our fellow man,
For in the end we all are one,
And our future lies in the little man.

It's true for you and it's true for me,
You don't need to be smart to see,
You've got to make more than the year before,
Just to keep from getting behind.

For the little man is getting smaller all of the time,

Out on the range I had my hat pulled low,
The Texas sun was hot and I had to go
I galloped all day on my paint pony brown,
But I had no fear with my six-shooter too.

Heading off to Sonora, the home of outlaws,
Where I knew I could find a good rowdy crowd
The legends said they'd take no guff around here,
So I'd face them all if I had to

CHORUS

Oh, when I ride into Sonora Town,
I'm ready to ride and stand my ground.
I'll take what's mine and ride into the night,
Don't mess with me in the town of Sonora's fight.

At the bar I heard the stories true,
Of the gunfights and of heroes made anew
I had to be strong and not let my courage fail,
'Cause I knew I had a story to tell

When I asked about a man named Jorge,
All of a sudden the saloon went still
Out of a corner spoke a voice so low,
He said he was here and his six-shooter too

CHORUS 

The bar filled with the smell of gunsmoke,
The card sharks turned tail and made a run
Jorge and I our guns in hand,
We'd make it out alive, but just barely this time

Jorge said, ""You ride with honor, my friend,
Our friendship is strong, it will never end""
We then drank our beers and tipped our hats,
The ultimate test had been passed

CHORUS 

Out on the range I pulled my hat low,
The Texas sun was hot and I had to go
I'd come a long way with my story so true,
But I found a friend in the town of Sonora",country

Heard a rumor the other day,
Saw some rustlers head this way,
Gonna need the boys from the old broken o
To bring 'em justice and make 'em go.

Saddle up the horses and ride,
Brandin' iron by our side,
Headin' out for the sun and dust,
Out on the trail of justice we must.

We'll ride in and bring 'em in,
Maybe cause a little sin,
Don't know what's gonna come our way,
But we'll take on the long hard day.

Twist and turn, riding on the range,
Never waver or give a change,
Gonna make the lawkeepers proud,
Gonna hear their hoorayin' sounds.

With the boys from the old broken o,
Will catch 'em quick and bring 'em in,
See the lawkeepers happy again.

Don't matter if we have no luck,
We'll keep riding until we're done,
Gonna teach them rustlers a lesson,
Show that justice can be won.

Drive 'em off and find 'em gone.

Verse 1
I was so lost in starlit dark, I could not see the light
It was so easy to deceive myself, in the search for some delight
I was wrong of course, in the pain and craziness, but the lessons were there all along
It took me time and ignorance, to finally find where I belong

Chorus
So take the spark, make it last, even if it isn't fair
It's in the craziness, and the pain, where you find the strength to bear
You have to go faithfully each day, and open up your head
Some great lifting force of light will come, to balance fearful night
Raise its voice, and then raise yours, raise its voice and then raise yours

Verse 2
The muse is softly knocking at my door, beckoning me to take the chance
To listen to the calling, and take control my life, to find the path where I can dance
And as I choose my destiny, I remember who I am
The spark is there all the time, if you only know to understand

So take the spark, make it last, even if it isn't fair

Verse 1 
I can still remember that late summer night, 
When you left me standing in the pouring rain. 
You said goodbye without a word and left me here alone,
All I had was a note on my pillow to comfort my soul.

Chorus 
Said I did nothing wrong, nothing wrong 
I tried to do everything I could for you. 
All I bring are cloudy days, nothing more. 
How many hearts will you break, before you find one good enough for you? 

Verse 2 
I know I wasn’t the right one for you,
But I stayed by your side and I always stayed true. 
If I did nothing wrong, then why’d you have to go? 
Didn’t you know I’d be here waiting, even when you didn’t show?

With all my broken dreams and unspoken fears,
It was like I lost my chance of salvation.

Chorus
Oh Lord, what have I done?
It seems like I must be the one,
That drove you away it’s just so hard for me to say,
That I did nothing wrong, nothing wrong.

Verse 2
I stayed by your side and I tried to be true,
But it was just not enough for you,
How many hearts will you break before you find true love,
And realize I was the one who was good enough?

From the speakers in my car,
It takes me back to the days when love was strong,

It was a hand that I knew before
It was my Virginia with a plea, 
For I must choose between jail and be
A son of faith, a different way
Than the shadows of my family

But I’d rot in jail, so scared and alone

Hands of mercy changed my fate
My life taken from the law and scorn 
And Virginia is the answer I’ve sworn

She pulled up in my driveway in her worn-down Chevy truck
A rusty old thing but she drove it with love
Her well-worn boots kicked up a cloud of red dust
A worn-out cowboy hat and her hair that I love so much
No matter where she goes I'm never too far behind
When she steps out into that morning light she's really something to see
My dreams come alive when I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees she's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's really something to see

When the sun dips and the night's falling in
We say our goodbyes and she's on her way again
But I know that I'm lucky, I'm blessed beyond belief
She's been my one true love for longer than I can see
No matter where she goes I'm never too far behind
When she steps out into that night's twilight she's really something to see
My dreams come alive when I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees she's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's really something to see

The years have gone by and life's been good to me
So thankful for all that she's done for me
This is one love that I'll never forget
She flipped the switch, now I'm forever lit
No matter where she goes I'm never too far behind

Its been a long day of work but I still can't get enough

She steps out into the night and the stars light up the sky
Her hair is a golden river of beauty, her eyes are bright
As I drive home I can't help but feel a love that's so strong and true 
She's too good to believe and I can tell you that she's really something to see 

When I'm lost in the darkness she's the one that I turn to
Her arms they keep me safe and warm and when I'm with her I know I'm home
No matter what happens I'll never feel alone 
She's too good to believe and I can tell you that she's really something to see

I'm drinking here on my own, whiskey's my only friend
As I get lost in the smoke, at this small-town dive again
It's a place I've known too well, the music tugs on my heart strings
But my heart still longs for a home and a love that I still can't find

My wife had to leave me when I just couldn't stay clean
Can't help but blame myself, for the broken dreams

I may shed a few tears but I don't cry too much
Even though I'm still upset since you left me in a rush

And not seeing that lovin' you is what I was tryin' to do

And watchin' you walk away and never knowing what could have been
And not seeing that love in you is what I was tryin' to do

Sometimes I force myself to smile when I run into our old friends

Where I can crank up the music til it's dark
Fill the room with the sound of a country jam
And just let it wash away my blues and my cares

Who'd pick up a guitar and strum out a country song,
She'd sing all day until the sun went down,
Her voice, so sweet, would keep the town all around.

Everyone knows the wild child's name,
She's a Southern Queen, and she don't feel no shame.

She'd sit on the car with a smoke in her lap,
Got a wild streak that's bound to break,
Ain't no one ever gonna take this girl's fate.

Countless broken hearts between the lines of gold,

She's seen it all and she's ready to go,

Verse 1
I'm not afraid to say I'm sorry, don't wanna cause more pain
Though with every breath I try to make it right, the damage stays the same
I can't escape my wrongs in the past, even though I've tried
Everywhere I go the guilt follows me, a heavy guilt I can't hide

Chorus
Shame on me, shame on me
Promises I made, and bills I never paid
Another missed birthday, shame on me, shame on me
Bridges I burned and lovers I've hurt, lessons I never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

Verse 2
What's done is done, I can't take back, my consequences I have to face
The words I speak out of turn, the hurt I can't erase
The truth of my sins beneath the skin, scared to let somebody in
Nobody showed me how to live, or how to live perfect, it's not worth it

Chorus
Hey, I'm not trying to be perfect, it's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not trying to be special, 'cause I ain't no angel

To break this yoke my heart carries around
I try hard but I just can't escape, the pain that I found

It's easy to blame the memories of what could have been
When something doesn't go our way, we all know what it means
We act like we're invincible, so nothing could touch us deep down inside
We knew this was coming, so why'd we try to hide

Chorus:
Shame on me, shame on me 
Broken hearts, dreams that never came true 
Shame on me, shame on me
Mistakes I made, and promises too few

It's hard to accept that sometimes things don't go as planned
We close our eyes and hope the darkness will help us understand
That even if we can't feel, our hearts still know what's right
But we try to deny it, and act like everything's alright

Chorus:
Shame on me, shame on me 
Bridges that I burned and lovers I hurt 
Shame on me, shame on me 
Lessons I never learned and bills I never paid

Hey I'm not tryin' to be perfect, it's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same, and we all share this fate
Hey I'm not tryin' to be special, cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same, what a shame

Bridge:
We all have our secrets and our skeletons of past mistakes
And sometimes it's easier to pretend that we won't break
Nobody can judge you if you never let them in
But if we never learn, then we'll never win

Verse 1

My mama used to tell me, don't be living in a world of sin
Stay away from parties and you'll be alright in the end
But the sirens on the corners, they gave me such a lure
So I got in too deep, and it's all I can't endure

Too many boyfriends and sociable sals will drive your sweetheart away
Oh what a fool I was to go and chase the midnight sun
And now I'm just a broken heart who's trying to overcome

I thought my carefree life was the only way to be
Hanging on to every face, and never looking back at me
But I guess I should've known, counted the cost before I'd start
Too many roads I travelled down, they broke my heart apart

Too many boyfriends and sociable sals will drive your sweetheart away
Oh what a fool I was to go and chase the midnight sun

He said this girl has strayed, she's a social enemy.
Her eyes reflect the nightlife, her cheeks they're red with paint,
But I know her mama was a saint.

We took the nightlife off the streets and brought it into our homes.

Softly the night was falling
The moon in the sky shone down on the land
The night was still and quiet
Not a whisper of sound from the sand

The little shepherd boy watched from the hill
On the holy night that would change lives still
He watched in wonder as the star lit up the sky
And knew this baby must be the Lord so high

He came to see the baby Lord
And bear witness to the miracle story told
The cattle lay lowing, the baby he did wake
But he shed no tears, just a silent grace

I love thee Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay with my heart until morning is nigh
Be near me Lord, I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever and ever I pray

With arms open wide, He takes us to His side
Leads us through love, and a mercy so divine
The gift of salvation and grace that never dies
Tis' a blessing we all can share in His light

He blesses the dear children, in His tender care
And holds us tight as He leads us to share
A life of grace, mercy, and love we'll find
When He takes us to the kingdom divine",country

It all started back in '08 when I strummed my first guitar strings  I took a risk and found my voice and used it to make a choice  Now I travel here and I'm there for the people and the shows they share  And I'm carrying on with the music that I love, it's all I do and I don't care 

I'm not saying I'm through by any means, I'm still learning and growing each day  And as long as I have a microphone in my hands and a song in my heart I'm here to stay 

I was just a young boy with a dream of making it big in the country scene  I know in my heart it's the only place I belong, I'm proud of everything I've seen 

Sometimes I think of the long nights on the road and I miss the days gone by  But all of the fans who come out from near and far I'm just so thankful I can't deny

A dusty patch of land way out of town.
I thought I'd take a chance to make my dreams come true,
And I hope you'll never forget me when I'm gone.

But there's some places I want to go.
That old steel guitar is the one I love best,
And I hope you'll never forget me when I'm gone.

I've watched the sun set on the prairie,
Riding in the back of my old truck.
I've felt the warm breezes blowing on my face,
And I hope you'll never forget me when I'm gone.

When I'm out on the stage, I feel like I'm home,
And I just get lost in the sound.
I'm still chasing down every dream I have,
And I hope you'll never forget me when I'm gone.

I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means,
There's some roads I still have to roam.
So please don't forget me when I'm gone,

Verse 1
We've all been searching for the truth,
Something that'll last longer than our youth.
We all seem to stray from the same broken path,
Til we finally find the light at the end of the map

Chorus
We're just a little grain of sand in His hand,
We're just a little grain of sand in His hand.
And though the darkness may surround us,
He's still the Maker, the Giver and the Taker.
He's everything we see or say or do,
He's the ultimate conception within the Master plan.
He's the Man.

Verse 2
We all try to find peace inside,
A way to be content with life.
In times of despair, He's our only hope,
There's no price too high or too low.

Chorus
We're just a little bit of wisdom in His mind,
We're just a little bit of wisdom in his mind.
And the more we learn, the more we understand,
He's the Maker, the Giver and the Taker.
He's everything we see or say or do,
He's the ultimate conception within the Master plan.
He's the Man.

Verse 3
We just need to have faith and believe,
Even when life can be so unkind.
No matter our struggles, He is here for us,
Through Him, our strength remains undaunted.

Chorus
We're just a little bit of pity in His heart,
We're just a little bit of pity in His heart.
But to Him, we belong, be us right or be us wrong,
He's the Maker, the Giver and the Taker.
He's everything we see or say or do,
He's the ultimate conception within the Master plan.
He's the Man.
He's the Man.",country

How long until one night you don't come home again

How long until I'm all alone again

I'm wasting time with you, I know it'll fall
I've promised myself, I won't make the same mistake
But the truth is there, that forever can break

My feet just keep on running back to you, it's hard to slow

Will forever last, or will I fall again

It ain't no nine-to-five, my days don't have an end
But I get by with a little help from my friends
Ain't had to rely on the government’s aid
I'm the man with the workin’ man's trade

Gonna keep on clocking in and deal with what I'm in
I gotta keep on trucking through
I might take a beer and sing a tune
Of these workin’ man blues (Repeat)

I'll keep on trucking through and these blues will set me free
I'm the working man, come on and join me

Verse 1
In a small town deep in Tennessee
A lonesome wolf's been stirring me
Dreaming of a better life
For his family and his pride
The odds are against him now
He's walkin' down that hard road
But he knows he can survive
If he just keeps his faith alive

Will the wolf survive
In the face of all his strife
Will he make it out alive

Peeking out from the morning fog
The weary wolf is on the run
And he's determined to move on
Through the dull ache of his pain
He's never once looked back again
And every step he takes draws near
A future he can finally see clear

Chorus
Will the wolf survive
In the face of all his strife
Will he make it out alive
Will the Wolf survive

But his courage it never fades
And the wind it will carry him
To a place where his faith will stay

Will the wolf survive, will he stay alive
Not just for himself but for those he loves
When the morning comes will he still be standing
With a heart that's strong and a will that's not giving in

Crossing rivers and mountains, with no rest in sight
Pushing back against the tide, standing in the fight
Though the odds are against him, he stands for what is right
With the fire still burning, his courage and his might

Rolled out of Lincoln and I'm California bound 
Had my sights set on the western coast so I hit the ground 
Straddled the Greyhound, it rolled me past Raleigh 
Crossed Carolina and it didn't take long to feel the wind on my face 

Ninety miles out of Atlanta, and I was feelin' just fine 
Rollin' right on through the Georgia state, I knew I'd make it in time 
But then the engine stopped and we were stranded outside of town 
So I bought a through train ticket, steamin' straight for Mississippi town

Ain't no time to waste, I know I'm near the promised land 
The train was rolling fast and no one tried to slow me down

Greeted by the warm ocean breeze outside of L.A.
Gonna see the Golden State, this is gonna be a dream come true

So I take a taxi to the terminal, California's my crown 

Don't have time to miss Virginia, I left it all behind

Maybe if I could show you, the love in my heart
You'd stay and cause my sunshine to never depart

Don't leave and take my sunshine away

Please understand how I feel, for I'm beggin' you to stay

Don't bring the sadness and tears, they'll only bring pain
Just hold me tight and never let go

" and the coast was clear with a silver gold dust moon on the horizon my Joanne an ode to her life my steaks burning Joan jett of arc

She'd ride in my pickup with a coffee and a smirk
The wind in her face as a whisper of a song
As we drove through the fields of Kansas of her small home town
My first love, my Joan Jett of Arc.

My heart was heavy, but the engine was fast
The stars shone bright like a million fireflies
The night air was still, no sound, no breeze
As I thought of all the times we shared with each other
My steak burnin' Joan Jett of Arc.

We'd ride the back roads, the bar parking lot
A virtual playground for the young and old
The diner we stopped at had the best of everything
And we'd sit and talk of days gone by, so long
My steak burnin' Joan Jett of Arc.

As we'd take in the sights, the highway's night song
The old gas stations and the neon signs
The roadside jukeboxes was a window to the past
Memories of a life spent in a far away time
My steak burnin' Joan Jett of Arc.

The fireflies they'd dance, stars they'd shine
As we drove the highway, to her home one last time
This life is a endless journey and I've had a love so true
I owe it all to my Joan Jett of Arc

After dinner's done and the lights go dim, we head down to the roller rink
Where the stars in the sky shine a halo around her soul so sweet

Mamma had a dream and dad was doin' his best
He said son you can't be tying me down, I'm only twenty-one
And a man's gotta get around if you know what I mean

Mamma said goodbye as she stood and cried
And Daddy said don't try, I'm gone
I gotta live my life, even though it hurt momma's pride
For my life was on a different kind of ride

I was baptized in country music, and I sang my way to fame
I traveled all around, across that country with no shame
I signed that dotted line, and I rode the wind to be a star
But I found out quickly, ain't no life on the road

From Georgia all the way to Texas, I sang my life away
From one city to the next, I just kept on goin'
I said goodbye to the old and hello to the new
But something deep inside was always missin' you

Finally in my heart I knew, I had to make a change
No more livin' my life on the road for somebody else's gain
I went back to find my roots and mamma was the first one I saw
She opened her arms and said ""My son, thank God you're back home""

Brushed the dust off my worn out hat,
Sat alone on the porch swing,
Waitin' on a truck that won't come back.

I drove out to the lake, overlooking the river shore
Sunlight beamin' bright, trees a-dancin' in the wind
Thought I'd take a dip and clear my head of hurt and pain
But there you were a-standin', memories of us remain

I wanted to believe it was a sign from above
That our love could be mended, you and I made new
Then you said ""Girl this time it's gonna be different
We both have grown, moved on and somehow it makes sense""

But I knew better than to fall for the same dream again
'Cause I've been down that road before, face it again and again
Oh, no, no, no, it's been too long ago
So, goodbye should mean goodbye, this time for sure

My heart came alive, walls I thought so strong
Started to crumble, oh this time it could be wrong
So I swallowed the fear, and I went with my heart
Closed my eyes tight and said ""Let's make this start""

Walking hand in hand, close to one another
Felt so much better, thinking we could find joy together
But these feelings remind me of the same old lie
Ain't gonna be fooled, this time goodbye means goodbye

So goodbye should mean goodbye, for us for good
Let's not start trying to pick what we never could
Oh, no, no, no, it's been too long ago 
So, goodbye should mean goodbye, this time for sure

We gotta let the past go and heal, it won't do us no good
And saying goodbye is the only way, we'll ever find the truth

Crossing the fields on a dusty caravan
There I met a Man, He offered me His hand
His eyes filled with love, but a sadness in His soul
My heart cried out for Him, for I knew He was so alone

He spoke of a mission, a burden that He bore
That He must take to save us, and make us whole once more
The forces of evil He'd face in that final fight
But His love for his people shone so bright

I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did as they watched Him die
And when He gave His all, they wept and they prayed
The sky filled with sorrow, a scene so grim and so strange

As He faced the cross and surrender His life
He carried the world upon His shoulders, and still He did not fight
God turned His head away, He couldn't bear the sight
It must have looked like rain when ten thousand angels cried

God turned His head away, He couldn't bear the sight
It must have looked like rain when ten thousand angels cried",country
"

The desert sky above that night was thick with clouds of gloom
The stars refused to shine as the shouts of crowds did boom
From a distance you could hear the cries of agony and shame
And a solemn hush fell below as his sacrifice he gave

I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did and the sky was set ablaze in red
As they bowed their heads and offered silent prayer
Cascading tears like a downpour of rain

The final hour had come to pass and breath soon drawn away
The earth begun to shake as death descended that day
Humbled by the sight of sacrifice divine
A heart of love forever still as they watched him suffer divine

I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did and the sky was set ablaze in red
As they bowed their heads and offered silent prayer
Cascading tears like a downpour of rain

The pain of that moment must have been too much to bare
That he would give his life for us with no second thought to spare
No greater love could He have given for the wrong to make it right
That we may forever live in peace beneath His Holy Light

I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did and the sky was set ablaze in red
As they bowed their heads and offered silent prayer
Cascading tears like a downpour of rain
The sorrow filled the air and pulled at every heart 
As love endured eternity beyond our mortal part
I'll never quite understand a love so divine 
But I'm sure they did when ten thousand angels cried",country

I got my tank full, I aint got no plans
So I parked my truck, down by the creek
Spread my boots up and sunk way down deep
