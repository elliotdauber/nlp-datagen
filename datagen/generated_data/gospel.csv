I never knew my life could be this way, no I never knew the joy I'd feel today,

Never felt this fire in my soul, but now I know the truth I'm fully whole.

There's a place in God where we can all be free,
Where we can find the perfect destiny,
There's a secret place in God we can all see,
Where grace will always carry me.

Never knew the peace I'd understand, I never knew my faith could expand,
Never thought I'd hear the sweetest sound, until I found Jesus and it turned my life around.

There's a place in God where we can all be free,
Where we can find the perfect destiny,
There's a secret place in God we can all see,
Where grace will always carry me.

But I never been in this place,
Time and time again I thought I'd never win,
But I never been in this place.

Ten miles out of Nashville, I was doing a hundred and one
A state boy pulled me over and said ""Where's the fire son?""
He said ""Where's the fire son?""
Well, I said ""Man there ain't no fire, I'm just running from a flame
Go on and write your ticket, but I ain't the one to blame""

Verse 3:
That county judge tried to rob me blind
So I rolled on down to Memphis, had nothing left to lose
I wanted to hear some rock and roll, but all they played was the blues
I didn’t wanna hear no blues
So I went to call up Elvis and Roger Miller grabbed the phone
He said drive that 18 wheeler, boy you’re the king of the road
Well, I said I was the king of the road

But these big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind

One clear morning, I awoke early, seeking the Lord's ever-living grace,
I heard angels singing in the distance, of a promise that could not be erased.
In the valley beyond the mountain, was where I was supposed to go,
And there waiting for me was the one I'd found, my love and my mountain rose.

Chorus:
Down in the valley beyond the mountain,
Where the birds sing a song so sweet,
I finally found my true love,
My rose from the mountainside.

She said she'd been waiting for me,
Forever it seemed,
Though I knew she was forever mine,
My rose from the mountainside.

As time went on, things changed for us,
A few years and a few tears apart,
But the love we found in the mountain,
Always filled us with hope and joy in our hearts.

On the night we said our vows,
I never felt so strong,
For I knew love had conquered all,
My rose from the mountainside.

Chorus:
Down in the valley beyond the mountain,
Where the birds sing a song so sweet,
I finally found my true love,
My rose from the mountainside.

Forever it seemed,
Though I knew she was forever mine,
My rose from the mountainside.

All our days were made of sunshine,
We'd laugh forever together,
Till the day my rose was taken away,
My rose from the mountainside.

I still remember my true love,
My rose from the mountainside.

Thinking of the power, with fancy cars and a fancy house in the sky, 
But what he never understood was that he'd never be fulfilled.

Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

Verse 3
No matter what the future may bring, 
Don't let your soul be swayed by material things, 
For we gain true contentment when we walk by His side, 
He will fill you with joy, blessed with a satisfied mind. 

Chorus
For you can't buy back your youth when you're old, 
Can't buy a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold,
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.",gospel

Verse 1
Have you ever wanted something so bad that you gave it everything you had
Searching for answers, just to find out it's too late
Feeling like everything was for naught, like you had nothing to show
Dreaming of a life filled with all that money can buy

Chorus
But you will never find contentment in riches and fame
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind is all that remains
Money won't buy you back your youth, or a true friend when you're down
The wealthiest person is a pauper, compared to the man with a satisfied mind

Verse 2
Maybe you got what you were looking for, but it still left you wanting more
The joy that you thought you'd find, suddenly fades away
But you still keep pushing on, desperately searching for a way
To fill that emptiness that haunts you night and day

Chorus
But you will never find contentment in riches and fame
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind is all that remains
Money won't buy you back your youth, or a true friend when you're down
The wealthiest person is a pauper, compared to the man with a satisfied mind

Verse 3
As life comes to an end and your time begins to run out
No matter what you have, it'll soon turn to dust
But through it all, one thing remains true
That you can leave this world with a satisfied mind, renewed

Chorus
You'll never find contentment in riches and fame
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind is all that remains
Money won't buy you back your youth, or a true friend when you're down
The wealthiest person is a pauper, compared to the man with a satisfied mind",gospel
