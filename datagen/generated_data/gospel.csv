I never knew my life could be this way, no I never knew the joy I'd feel today,

Never felt this fire in my soul, but now I know the truth I'm fully whole.

Where we can find the perfect destiny,
There's a secret place in God we can all see,
Where grace will always carry me.

Never knew the peace I'd understand, I never knew my faith could expand,
Never thought I'd hear the sweetest sound, until I found Jesus and it turned my life around.

There's a place in God where we can all be free,
Where we can find the perfect destiny,
There's a secret place in God we can all see,
Where grace will always carry me.

But I never been in this place,
Time and time again I thought I'd never win,

He said ""Where's the fire son?""
Well, I said ""Man there ain't no fire, I'm just running from a flame
Go on and write your ticket, but I ain't the one to blame""

Verse 3:
That county judge tried to rob me blind
So I rolled on down to Memphis, had nothing left to lose
I wanted to hear some rock and roll, but all they played was the blues
I didn’t wanna hear no blues
So I went to call up Elvis and Roger Miller grabbed the phone
He said drive that 18 wheeler, boy you’re the king of the road
Well, I said I was the king of the road

One clear morning, I awoke early, seeking the Lord's ever-living grace,
I heard angels singing in the distance, of a promise that could not be erased.
In the valley beyond the mountain, was where I was supposed to go,
And there waiting for me was the one I'd found, my love and my mountain rose.

Chorus:
Down in the valley beyond the mountain,
Where the birds sing a song so sweet,
I finally found my true love,
My rose from the mountainside.

She said she'd been waiting for me,
Forever it seemed,
Though I knew she was forever mine,
My rose from the mountainside.

As time went on, things changed for us,
A few years and a few tears apart,
But the love we found in the mountain,
Always filled us with hope and joy in our hearts.

On the night we said our vows,
I never felt so strong,
For I knew love had conquered all,
My rose from the mountainside.

Chorus:
Down in the valley beyond the mountain,
Where the birds sing a song so sweet,
I finally found my true love,
My rose from the mountainside.

My rose from the mountainside.

All our days were made of sunshine,
We'd laugh forever together,
Till the day my rose was taken away,
My rose from the mountainside.

I still remember my true love,

Thinking of the power, with fancy cars and a fancy house in the sky, 
But what he never understood was that he'd never be fulfilled.

Don't let your soul be swayed by material things, 
For we gain true contentment when we walk by His side, 
He will fill you with joy, blessed with a satisfied mind. 

Chorus
For you can't buy back your youth when you're old, 
Can't buy a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold,
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.",gospel
"

Verse 1
Have you ever wanted something so bad that you gave it everything you had
Searching for answers, just to find out it's too late
Feeling like everything was for naught, like you had nothing to show
Dreaming of a life filled with all that money can buy

Chorus
But you will never find contentment in riches and fame
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind is all that remains
Money won't buy you back your youth, or a true friend when you're down
The wealthiest person is a pauper, compared to the man with a satisfied mind

Verse 2
Maybe you got what you were looking for, but it still left you wanting more
The joy that you thought you'd find, suddenly fades away
But you still keep pushing on, desperately searching for a way
To fill that emptiness that haunts you night and day

Chorus
But you will never find contentment in riches and fame
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind is all that remains
Money won't buy you back your youth, or a true friend when you're down
The wealthiest person is a pauper, compared to the man with a satisfied mind

Verse 3
As life comes to an end and your time begins to run out
No matter what you have, it'll soon turn to dust
But through it all, one thing remains true
That you can leave this world with a satisfied mind, renewed

Chorus
You'll never find contentment in riches and fame
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind is all that remains
Money won't buy you back your youth, or a true friend when you're down
The wealthiest person is a pauper, compared to the man with a satisfied mind",gospel

Come on let's follow the sound,
Where the cotton grows on the ground,
Down to the southern part of the town,
And gather around,
The music's playing loud,
Let its rhythm move us proud,
And bring us closer together
As the banjo makes its sound.

Chorus
My Dixie darling, listen to this song I sing,
Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune,
My heart is ever true, I love no one but you,
My Dixie darling, my Dixie queen.

Verse 2
Down below the Mason Dixon line,
Where the honeysuckles are entwined,
The southern winds are blowing,
The daisies growing,
The girls of the north in the gay finery,
Whirling around in the society,
Singing a song of Dixie darling
Where I long to be.

Chorus
Going down south to have a big time,
To see my girl in old Caroline,
I'll drink my booze and do as I please,
For all those girls I long to squeeze,
Singing songs of Dixie darlings
There's where I long to be.

Going down where the jelly roll's growing,
With my Dixie queen.

Chorus
My Dixie darling, listen to this song I sing,
Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune,
My heart is ever true, I love no one but you,
My Dixie darling, my Dixie queen.",gospel

Verse 1
In a little village there a man I saw
Lost his sight, I felt the need to help him cross the highway
The weight of his troubles seemed heavier than mine
I saw the light of day, but he felt his way

And I need not feel my way
Thy burdens, thy burdens

On a journey I saw a lad so fair
His leg was crippled yet he still tried to play the game
Though no words passed his lips, in his eyes was understanding
Life had been so unkind, I said in sorrow

Chorus
Thy burdens are greater than mine
And I need not feel my way
Thy burdens, thy burdens

Verse 3
In a graveyard one day I saw such a sight
A young man kneeling with roses in his hands
A prayer written on a stone, his memories of God so sweet
My heart spoke in sorrow, your burdens are so deep

Chorus 
Thy burdens are greater than mine
And I need not feel my way
Thy burdens, thy burdens

Verse 4
I'm just a drifter, all alone on this road
No friends, no home, but my heart knows the weight of another's load
My heart cries out in sorrow, this burden I can help bear
Let me help lighten the load, sharing in your prayer

Thy burdens are greater than mine
And I need not feel my way

Oh praise the Lord accolades to Him,
For His love so strong He did not stint;
Though weaker than a life-less grain, 
His arms He stretched out in the rain.

Our Saviour, His mercy is just,
His grace so deep, like no other trust;
Though we sin and fail, His love remains,
Our place of refuge so that none complains.

Chorus:
Oh I love You Jesus, yes I do,
I love You Jesus, yes it's true;
Satan's the choice of the majority,
But You're the choice of the minority.

You are our God, our King, and Lord,
Our Saviour, our great reward;
The death You died, Your blood just flew,
It's all cause you love me like I love You.

Through us spread love, joy and peace,
The Father's kingdom ever increases;
If we have faith, each one of us,
We'll be His children out of the dust.

Lift up Christ, the name of God,
In the day when all will bow;
The power and glory, oh the Lord be,
And honor and praises come forevermore.

Oh I love You Jesus, yes I do,
I love You Jesus, yes it's true;
Satan's the choice of the majority,
But You're the choice of the minority. (Repeat)",gospel

Come and listen to my story, it's something that is true.
A young girl had a vision that God would make her true.
Way down in the blue ridge mountains, way down where tall pines grow,
My sweetheart of the mountain, she's my little Heaven's rose.

God blessed her with a calling, an angel on her side.
He held her close and loved her, His love she couldn't hide.
Way down in the blue ridge mountains, way down where tall pines grow,
My sweetheart of the mountain, she's my little Heaven's rose.

We sang songs of glory together, praises to the Lord,
Our faith in Him was strong, but of Him we never bored.
Way down in the blue ridge mountains, way down where tall pines grow,
My sweetheart of the mountain, she's my little Heaven's rose.

The Lord has been so gracious, He's shown us love and grace.
His blessings have been plenty, we've seen Him face to face.
Way down in the blue ridge mountains, way down where tall pines grow,
My sweetheart of the mountain, she's my little Heaven's rose.",gospel

The sun was setting on the mountain and I heard the church bells chime I took my love by the hand, we knelt and said a prayer of thanks divine 

Long ago in the blue ridge mountains, where the tall pines still stand For His grace and His loving kindness, and my little Georgia Rose in hand 

We often sang praise and worship, as we felt the Spirit move We could feel His presence strong and true, like a beacon from heaven above 

Oh blessed is the one who seeks Him, in the morning and in the night He is my Lord and my Savior, shining ever so bright

Way down in the blue ridge mountains, way down where the tall pines grow There's my sweetheart of the mountain, she's my little Georgia Rose",gospel
