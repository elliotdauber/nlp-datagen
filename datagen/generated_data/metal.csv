Grab a bottle to drink up the pain relieving potion

Believing in nothing, engulfed in the night,
My life's taken its toll, I'm living in despair,
Searching for refuge but nothing is there.

These secrets I'll give to you will turn virtue to vice,

A sorrowful truth that will never be found.

Abuse of power, corruption you'll soon know
Bury justice in the dirt, no one's there to free us
It's part of this broken game, these lies they'll never see us

Chorus 1:
Take us, blind us, tie us up, drown us in the dark, oblivious
Scars are your grand work of art, we cannot fight
We're reaching out, two hands, searching for solace in vain
An illusion, a play, nothing left to retain

Verse 2:
Take it at face value don't get a means to an end
A dishonorable oath to serve and protect the hand that feeds
Drops harder as time passes by, a power trip fueled by mass control
Criminals, a badge won't justify, reaching excuses, marks oblivious

Chorus 2:
Man blind and corrupt, opinions you've got no leg to stand
Deny and oppress, you don't know that it's wrong
Blur the lines, we're quick to put the blame on minority lives
To justify the end of authorities crime

Outro:

Rage of the Beast

You create the pain, the agony you suffer
Playing with fire, the flames will never die
The hatred that you feel, you can't ignore it
You take it out on me, like I'm the enemy

Rage of the beast, inside of you swelling
Consuming every thought and crippling your core
You're too blind to see, or too scared to accept
That I know the truth, this is your own fault

Constant sorrow, is no way to live
The empty void, that you can never fill
Your vicious temper, it never lets up
It will consume you, until you have enough

Rage of the beast is the path you follow
Afraid of the sunlight, you will forever wallow
In your own despair, in your own soul brew
Your own lies, you will forever rue

Living in darkness, where only misery lies
You can't escape, from your own demise
Your own suffering, you try to deny it
But it will eat away, every reason you ever had

Rage of the beast, where darkness is king
You can't repress it, it's your everything
Face your terror, you know what it means
To find the courage, and break free from the chains.",metal

I try to make it through the chaos
But it's an uphill battle that I fight
I'm consuming every inch of this madness
Trying to keep alive what's left of the light
So in the midst of this war going on
I won't let go of my beliefs
I'm ready to face what's coming
Until death do us part, united we'll stand

Chorus
We are nothing like these creatures
Guilty and scarred from what we've done
The price of our pride is too high
We'll feed our own selfishness
We are nothing like these creatures
Guilty and scarred from what we've done
The price of our pride is too high
We'll let the bastards surround us

The diseased and dying have no hope
There is no peace in violence

So many have suffered and the cries cannot be denied.

Forced to accept the plague of corruption rising like a sand.

The truth is hidden and the lies are prevailing.
No justice for the innocent who've been taken away,
The darkness overpowers and the faith starts to fade.

Only by uniting, can we rise up against the deadly frost.

In a never-ending cycle of pain and despair

Never thought that I could be so lost in my own despair,
Living in a world that constantly wears me down.
Drowning in a sea of rage, no one around to hear me scream,
I feel like I'm in a prison, a living hell that's never serene.

As I fly on my own, I'm free to explore my thoughts,
Wandering in a place I've never been before.
Away from the pain and suffering, a life I no longer dread,
Closing my eyes and hold my breath 'til I'm no more.

My heart still beats like a drum, will it ever find its way?
Shadows pass me by in my journey to find a brighter day.
Caught in the darkness, lost in the endless night,
Wide awake and stare up to the sky in search of the light.

As I fly on my own, I'm free to explore my thoughts,
Wandering in a place I've never been before.
Away from the pain and suffering, a life I no longer dread,
Closing my eyes and hold my breath 'til I'm no more.

Though I feel that I'm alone, I know that's not the case,
For I am surrounded by friends I can't see but embrace.
Lost in my own world, the fear and the doubt,
I'm ready to take the plunge and free myself from the rout.

Standing in the shadows I'm feeling so alone
Stranded in a world I can't escape on my own
The guilt it constantly gnaws inside of me
It's eating me alive, I'm a walking tragedy

My hands on the wheel, I'm desperately hoping
That soon I'll be free from this sorrowful abyss
The light that I seek, can I find it in this

As we fly on our own, hopelessness 
Overpowers me as I try to find home 
The struggles of life, don't go unseen 
My broken wings, I can't break free

I'm walking on a tightrope, fighting until the end 
The demons in my mind, I must defend 
The days are getting longer, and the nights darker still 
The weight of my guilt, it's a constant chill 
I'm locked in an endless cycle, a cycle of despair 
A realm of shadows, with no one there
The fight I must fight, I just can't win 
I'm lost in the dark, with no sign of my sin

Chorus:
As we fly on our own, hopelessness 
Overpowers me as I try to find home 
The struggles of life, don't go unseen 
My broken wings, I can't break free

As I finally accept this, this is my fate
Falling through the darkness, I must face it on my own
My soul's in a prison, I'm a prisoner of my own mind
Now I'm screaming my pain, as I'm losing my time

As we fly on our own, hopelessness 
Overpowers me as I try to find home 
The struggles of life, don't go unseen

Falling in the void, I will never be the same

I'm watching the fire burn all around me,
This prison of misery is closing in,
Chained to my hell all I can do is scream,
But I'm not giving in!

Screaming through the night my soul is searching,
Ripping my skin apart, I feel the thirst,
I'll take this broken bone and use it as a sword,
My revenge is coming first!

You brought me to this place and I won't die here,
I can feel the power inside,
And with a heavy heart I'm now reclaiming my life,
As I cut off the binds! 

Chorus:
Cutting through my pain I will no longer remain,
I'll take my broken wings and fly,
The strength to face this fight comes from deep inside,
I will never die!

Tear it down, break loose these walls,
I'm shaking off the fear,
No more will I be fooled by your deceiving ways,
Go on and disappear!

Nothing left to stop me now,
I'm burning all the lies,
I'm taking back my life and I won't look back,
You've been erased from my life!

Chorus:
Cutting through my pain I will no longer remain,
I'll take my broken wings and fly,
The strength to face this fight comes from deep inside,
I will never die!

So as I make my way through these ashes,
I'm watching them all burn and fade away,
The fire gives me strength and I'm no longer bound,
This freedom is here to stay!

Chorus:
Cutting through my pain I will no longer remain,
I'll take my broken wings and fly,
The strength to face this fight comes from deep inside,
I will never die, I will never die!",metal

Verse 1:
I'm feeling the pain, tearing my heart in two
Dragged down by the weight of the noose, I'm stuck in this ghost of you
My sanity's slipping away, I'm struggling to stay afloat
I feel the rope tightening, I won't be crushed by your throat

Chorus:
I've cut you out, set me free
Lynched high above what used to be
In your gallows, built for me
I escaped, I broke free

My faith has been tested like never before

A heartache that doesn't seem to subside

A reminder of what we've lost that night
A broken heartache that won't go away
I'm left behind in constant dismay

Someone wake me when it's over

A tragedy, nothing can explain
The cost of one life, so much pain
You should have been here, living life to the fullest
But I'm stuck in the memories of those moments we had

Someone wake me when it's over

Evil lurks behind every door

The darkness of your lies
Ain't no reason to deny
A broken heart and broken dreams
You'll never hear me scream
No more lies you've said
My love for you is dead

The fire within my veins is gone

Your lies just seem to haunt me
Now it's time I face the truth
Alone it's where I've been for you

Fading away my shattered soul,

Raining down my despair,
Climbing up from the darkest hole,
No hope anywhere.

Gonna stand tall and never give in.

Time to move forward no more pain,
A brand new start is what I need,
Time to take my life back again.

I'll make my own choices and stand on my own,
Time to write my own destiny,
No more living in the shadows,
Gonna find my peace and be set free.

Roaming through the stellar fields, a new beginning is what we claim 
We're blowing off on this ouroboran wind and never coming down 
Never again fall back into this abysmal ground

We all fade away into the grey, a place so familiar to us all 
The chill of the night, won't let us forget the past that we must recall 
What world awaits us when this one is drab and desolate 
What fate awaits us when the walls are drained and vacant 

Elevate yourself to the sun, incinerate and let the ashes reign 
Roaming through the stellar fields, a new beginning is what we claim 
From the ashes of despair a new day shall rise 
Our suffering remains fade away as our new end starts to align 

Stay away from the old ways, starting over and never look back 
Stay away from the betrayal, let the truth be what we track 
Elevate yourself to the sun, incinerate and let the ashes rain

We are born anew in a world of our own
We stand unified and with strength we now grow
No more suffering, our future is our own

We've been fighting for too long
To see our old ways undone
A new dawn is here, we are finally free
Rising from the ashes, a new seed we will sow

Rise up with us, brothers and sisters
As we start again, fresh and strong
No longer will we be shackled by fear
Let us bring in the dawn of a new song

Embrace the future, together we will stand
No more pain and suffering in our land
This is a new beginning for all of us here
Come join us and let us be reborn

Rise up, raise our voices
A new age of harmony and peace
No more sorrow and no more pain
A world of hope, where joy never fades

A new life we will now create
All of us unified and strong, we will never break
Soar into the sky, and let our spirits fly
The past is over, this is a new dawn of life",metal

" so tell me how it should be

Fading memories linger within me
Like a disease no one can see
Stumbling through the shadows of the night
Can't help but feel so dismayed

My soul is so empty, left in despair
So I scream out in rage
Feeling this pain inside my veins
As I try to escape these chains

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I'm searching for a way to find solace
In this world of constant pain

Can't let another page burn away
I search for a reason to stay
I'm desperate to find a way out
But I can't seem to find a way

I don't want to die for anyone
I can't bear this pain for so long
No one here can understand
What I've become

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I'm searching for a way to find solace
In this world of constant pain

Can't let another page burn away
I search for a way to stay alive

But I can't seem to find a way

My struggles keep dragging me down
All I can do is keep on searching
For solace inside this pain",metal
" so tell me how it should be

I can feel the fires burning, as I'm consumed in rage,
Searching for solace, in a world gone insane,
My misery unfolding, warping in these flames,
I've nowhere to turn, nothing can remain.

I'm pushed to the limit, a prisoner of fear,
Cursed with this boundary, no hope is here,
Time to face my demons, what lies beneath,
There's no way out, I won't be relieved.

Something's getting in the way, something's closing in,
My fate will be written, in the book of sin,
I'll search for redemption, and find again,
Guide me down this path, 'till I'm set free from pain.

Desperate I will crawl, waiting for so long,
No love here is no love, death for anyone.
What have I become, as I try to break free,
Held captive by chains, an eternity.

Something's getting in the way, something's just about to break,
I will try to find my way, will I ever escape?
Burning and rage fills me, my soul is in despair,
Unable to break the chains, and find what's out there.

I'm ready to take the chance, and face my destiny,
No help I shall receive, I will fix my own calamity,
Standing tall and brave, trying to conquer this land,
So tell me how it should be, will I ever understand?",metal

Walking in a dreary state of mind,
The city is lost, as I am standing still,
Unfriendly sidewalks, streetlights faintly glow,
My palm pressed against the dead cold iron pole.

Thoughts navigate the grey density all around,
Hiding in the confinement of a filthy back alley,
Swallowed up by darkness, the city's losing tally.

Coughing out of habit, though I've never smoked,
Passing giants of manmade desires,
Spreading their wings of darkness for miles.

The air's thick with the scent of cigarettes and liquor on my breath.

Driven faster to the nothingness, 
No control locked in this mess. 
Spinning madly on this wheel of fate,
Our souls doomed to this hateful state.

Chorus:
Show the way point to nothing,
Show the way profit from loss. 
Time is space ticking slow decay,
Ascend across love percolates.

Drowned in sin condemning us all,
Bearing the cross our hearts take the fall.
Marching forward to an unseen fate,
As our masks begin to break.

Chorus:
Fill up the cup or pour out the shame,
The candlelight burns the room to ash and dust.
Clone the same light the flame,
Prove that this sham will save me.

Heal the thirst of knowledge, 
Turn a blind eye forward,
Good things come to those who wait,
Always over compensate.

Chorus:
Watching the blood percolate, 
Hide the keys within their faith.
Hide within the shadow,
Brainwashed into who you trust.

Your lungs filled with ash and dust, 
Take that final breath,
Brainwashed into who you trust,
Hide within the shadow. 

Secular forbidden thoughts,
Put them underground,
Smother them from life,
Always unforgiven.

Enslave all the living, 
Your lungs filled with ash and dust,
Put them underground,
Smother them from life. 

Outro:
Good things come to those who wait, 
Constant sleep watch it collapse. 
Watch shit collapse,

Under the weight of this pain, you can’t take but one more step

A broken dream and burning rage 
Forced to take a stand and fight,

The darkness that consumes our minds

To make our own escape from this world

No matter how hard they try, 
We will never succumb to the night

Rise up, arise and take the fight 
Take up the sword and never back down,

A purpose and a way to soar 
We raise our fists and stand with pride, 
Our enemies will never take us alive

To take a life in your hands?

Just a hollow shell of who I used to be 
My broken faith and shattered dreams, questions left unanswered silently 
My life is gone, our paths will never cross again

No remorse, no regret 
No one to hear this last song I sing 
The void is growing, my hope is slipping away 
The river of life is flowing, but I can't find the way

My heart is aching, my soul is breaking 
The pain will never leave, I can never be free
But I'll carry on, keep believing
This day will end and I will be set free

The cursed must die in a blinding light

The heat from the sauna, a smoldering ember
A god of the trees and the creatures of night

In dreams they speak to me, of the truth that means reality
In dreams they speak to me, of the truth that means reality
In dreams they call to me, of the truth that means reality
In dreams they beckon me, of the truth that means reality

Unseen creatures howl in pain, as shadows dance around my heart
Unearthly voices chant my name, as I slowly fade away
Memories of my past life, slowly slipping away

A burning fire, a searing pain, I can’t survive
My mind is spinning, my body’s weak, I know I’ll never win
A suicidal ride I take, can’t escape my untold sin
Chorus
Living too fast, I’m sinking in fast
Living too fast, so I can’t last
Living too fast, no time to waste
Living too fast, I’m on a suicidal ride
Verse 2
Temptation brought it on, no control, my crystal lies
The agony I feel, a dark abyss, I’m in disguise
Hallucinations overtake me, I can’t see the light
Futile efforts, I will die, I’m giving up the fight
Chorus
Living too fast, I’m sinking in fast
Living too fast, so I can’t last
Living too fast, no time to waste
Living too fast, I’m on a suicidal ride
Bridge
I’m lost in an abyss, my mind so twisted and blind
A never-ending night, I can’t escape my own demise
Can’t stop the death, I’m living too fast
Spiraling down in a free fall, I’m headed for my last
Chorus
Living too fast, I’m sinking in fast
Living too fast, so I can’t last
Living too fast, no time to waste
Living too fast, I’m on a suicidal ride
Outro
Living too fast, living too fast
Living too fast, living too fast",metal

Seeking solace from the madness, the darkness ever growing

Day after day he brought destruction and with his might he brought much pain
People were frightened and shaken and scared the truth was clear to all 
The dragon had to be destroyed people knew they had no say in this at all 
But one old man Chan Kalili decided to stand up and fight 
So he made a plan to take down the dragon with all his power and might 
Everyone laughed but he still prepared chanting 
Dragon kills people dragon kills lamb dragon kills people dragon kills lamb 
But the dragon wont kill Chan Kalili monster dragon will surely die
That night Chan Kalili stayed up all night to prepare the challenge he'd face
He painted his body with the colors of nature and fixed feathers to his dress
He painted a black circle around his neck and wrapped a band around his wrist 
And with white clay he decorated his face and the drums of battle he hit 
The next day had come so Chan Kalili marched on till he reached the dragon's lair

Cursed be my broken soul
The paths have been untold
The dark and heavy burden that has taken its toll
The waves flow over me, a familiar sea
My wings have been clipped and I'm only me

My feet have walked these roads, countless times before
But I'm too broken to move, and too weak to explore
The waters they call my name, beckoning me home
I'm searching and longing, so far from my throne

The beauty of thy pain, I cannot deny
I know it'll come with a heavy price to pay
Am I blessed or am I damned, in thy presence
What is my sin that's led me here today

Release the chains and come for me
Return to the soaring cliffs, so strong and free
My burning flame is in hunger, my fire won't cease
The ashes of destiny have been scattered in peace

In the distance, the waves mix and clash
They offer a glimpse, a possible path
Grant me the sight, so I can see
What lies ahead in this realm of death

My call is strong, it echoes through the night
I'm ready to stand and face my fight
The gargoyles await, from their bowed ships
Bidding me on board, this is my mission complete.",metal

Searching for a way out of this darkness I'm bound
Far from the light, It's so hard to swim to the other side
The fear of the deep is creeping in, my heart drowns
My hope is fading, My will is breaking, I'm losing my mind

Stuck in this sea of torment and pain, No longer believing
Blood in solid state, Nothing moves on the scene anymore

My mind is lost within my dreams
Pinned down, and wrapped up in the arms of sleep

Bow down before the master cruel

Sacrifice your thoughts, just succumb to the game
Filled with fear and disappointment, you cannot be the same

The race for complication, communicate reaction

Drowning in hatred, I'm encased in despair,
Searching for freedom, I reach for the stairs.

I want to escape, but I'm caught in a loop,
The only way out is to start anew.

Erase the pain and make everything just fine 
That would be my true chance to make things right

Sweltering heat of the night's embrace,
A flame of crimson, to fuel my hate,
Chilling fear and silent screams,
My heavy hand of death bestowed upon thee.

Surrounded by destruction and misery,
My realm of darkness, my own sanctuary,
Spreading hatred and fire everywhere,
Send these wretched souls to their eternal despair.

Screaming for mercy, of mercy you'll plead,
Your fate uncertain and your wits you will bleed,
My lyrical prose of terror and guilt,
My dark words, your judgement and doom will be built.

The burning stench of rotting flesh and bone,
My reign of terror will never be out-done,
Enveloped in flames your soul I shall take,
Choking on ash, beware what I can create.

Inflict my horror to the heart of weaker, useless souls I despise,
No longer will I allow my enemies to continue life,
Eye of judgement staring at you, turn your face and hide,
I impose my wrath upon you, imploring me you'll die.",metal

Walk away in silence, see the light in all their faces

Rage and fury, a burning desire
Coursing through my veins with a raging fire
The heat of violence, darkness and despair
A vision too grand for me to bear

A darkness so deep, I'm fumbling around
Can't find my way out, I'm lost and I'm bound
Colliding with the gates of hell and the sky
Yet I still carry on with the will to survive

Oh no I've said too much
I set it up that's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it

Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought I heard you laugh
I thought I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions

Grasping for the flame I'm begging to be saved
From a prison of doom and a life of the enslaved
With a prayer and a verse I will march onward
Upon a throne of strength never to be forgotten

Oh no I've said too much
I set it up that's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it

Oh no I've said too much

I thought I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

Slipping through the shadows of the damned
Frozen in the air, eyes of death in his hand
Kneeling at the altar, call the kz necromancer
Hear the screams of the living, pain inside his eyes

Crowded in the vaults, the gruesome work of mengele
Torture in the cells, witness to his deeds
Ripping out flesh, extracting fluids of hate
Shaking with fear, with the necromancer's fate

Chorus 
Kz necromancer, twisting death and life
Kz necromancer, seed of the fuhrer's strife
Kz necromancer, spawn of the abyss

Unholy force growing strong, forward is his quest
Mutations and experiments, twisted souls are born
His glory and his pride, the death he adorned

Misery has found me once again.

We march towards our fate in the dark of night

A spark of life in a world of the blue.
Our memories seem to fade with the years,
But we'll keep searching to see what appears.

Lead us to the light, so we can be free,
But our time is short and we must not flee.
We must look for truth, our courage we must use,
For someday soon we will have to choose.

Spinning 'round in our endless song.
In the ruins of life, we'll keep on dancing,
In the ruins of life, we'll keep on prancing.

We can join the fight, and fight together,
In a world that's fraught with fear and weather.
We'll stand up tall and never be scared,
For we know that we'll be forever paired.

No matter what comes, we'll never give up,
No matter how dark, our souls won't corrupt.
Let's face the storm, and glimpse the light,
And stand together, through the night.

Through the ruins we won't let fear attack.
We'll stay the course, and we'll stay proud,
In the ruins, may our voices be loud.

Verse 1:
Rising from the ashes of despair,
I'm determined to stand tall and win this fight
Putting my back against the wall, I'm ready to break away from this plight 
Time to stand up, break these chains that bind me, 
Reclaim and demand my freedom loud and clear
Ain't no way they'll ever keep me down, 
Gonna fight 'til the dawn of the new day is here

Chorus:
Cause they got you comin' in, they got you goin' out
Same amount in n out, aint no way round the system 
Money makes this world go 'round, all the way they got you down
Say you've had enough, gonna throw yourself out a window
Might cost you less to stick around and break out from this hell-hole

Verse 2:
I'm courageous, and I'm refusing to surrender,
Gonna battle this storm 'til the end
No more staying put, cravin' for something better,
My pride won't allow me to bend
I'll never be enslaved by corrupt systems of power, 
Keeping me broke and in debt
My mind's made up and I won't turn back,
Watch me rise and ascend

Chorus:
Cause they got you comin' in, they got you goin' out
Same amount in n out, aint no way round the system

Verse 1:
Have you been enslaved since your birth? 
It’s a debt you’ll pay for your life, until you’re all done 
Bills looming, they’re staring in your eyes 
You can have it now, pay the price later 
Work out a payment plan now 
Work for the man, stuck in a cycle you can’t get rid of

Money makes the world go round, it has you held down 
Sick of this system, you can’t give up
Say you’ve had enough, you wanna throw yourself out
But it’ll cost less to stay around for one more payment

It’s up to you, is it a plan or an opportunity? 
One thing’s for sure, nothing’s free

Same amount in and out, no way around the system

From the depths of the seas arise a demon's woe
A whisper of dread, the kingdom's fate ready to show
Chained by the gods, not meant to be known
Without a sound, the legacy of the ancients will be overthrown

A void of despair, with no one in sight
The darkness of night, the fear of the might
The temple walls that shimmer and glow
Surrounded by secrets, soon ready to be blown

As if cursed by fate, no chance for salvation
The essence of evil, the darkest sensation
The gods of the land, will never be forgotten
Lost in a wave, a promise of no returning

Old world to you we all belonged
Old world the stars announced your fall
Ignotum fatum dark mantis
Dark fate of Atlantis

At the gates of a timeless dimension
Dwell the ghosts of a myth not forgotten
Kept by the sirens and their infinite cry
The one surviving the oceans might

Dark mantis dark fate of Atlantis
At the gates of a timeless dimension
Dwell the ghosts of a myth not forgotten
Kept by the sea lords and their infinite force
The one surviving the gods remorse

Che vibra ed arde vivida nei secoli

As their world took a dive
The gods unleashed their wrath
The future seemed unclear
The only ones living this nightmare
Were the brave ones near and far

Bringing chaos all around
Angels crying in the night,
Painful screams of mighty might

Fleeing to make a change
Abandon all that stands in the way
A new dawn awaits me today

Take my hand and come with me,
A place of freedom you will see
This world of deception will burn,
Fight for what we must learn

Breaking away, it is time to fly,
Grasp the courage and defy
Open the cage and break the chain,
Set us free and feel the rain

Rise up, the storm of rebels call,
Fight the powers that oppress us all
Hearts beating, we'll never give in,
The power of the will within

Breaking away we have the strength,
To put an end to their reign of death
Fear no more what they preach,
An age of justice we will reach

Breaking away, no longer prisoners,
End the fight and seize the day

A wall that stands so tall, crimson skies they speak the truth
Ignore their words, it's written in stone, unyielding lies to me
If I don't follow their ways, I'd be banished from this sea

I'll take my moments, conquests and defeats, just a product of my fate
No other dream I can't achieve, stand against the rising hate
My ambition won't be denied, shallow shall be their graves
Each step taken by my guide burn out the pretense that remains

Their hellfire is my path of light, as I blaze my way through
Their schemes will be futile, and their feeble minds will lose
When I'm standing at the gates, I will be unafraid
Their abyss of lies, left to die, their commandments fade away

I am law I am right, threshold of pain, like you ever lived in vain

For when the storm rises and winds are fierce
The fire of righteousness will ever last
Burning with intensity and will to resist

Fear no longer his oppressive reign
For we have written our declaration
Holding fast to the will power
Our minds on liberation ever remain

And our courage will never be bent

Retreating not one step from victory

Thru astral layers the voyage goes on,
Perished among the stars forever to be gone.

Searching the insanity of mine,
Mourning as I dwell among no laughter,
Hoping my existence ends hereafter.

To where nothing is and nothing was,
And their whispers greet my loss in the watery mirror of destiny,
I can not see my own reflection,
Thru the dead halls of infinity,
I hear them sing for me.",metal

Rage is boiling in my veins, raging like an inferno,
My heart beat's beating like a drum pounding below.
The anger that I feel is strong, feeding my desire,
My final strand is now released, I'll no longer be impure.

Falling downwards, I'm embracing my fate,
Falling downwards, into a darkened place,
Falling downwards, I'm being dragged into the abyss,
Falling downwards, I can't escape this evil bliss.

The pain will never go away, I'm burning in the fire,
My inner demons won't let go, my soul is inspired.
The pain just won't subside, trapped in a southern vent,
My final strand is now in sight, I can tear this wall apart.

Falling downwards, I'm embracing my fate,
Falling downwards, into a darkened place,
Falling downwards, I'm being dragged into the abyss,
Falling downwards, I can't escape this evil bliss.

No one will hear my prayers, my faith is forever lost,
My power is gone, consumed by flames, my life a scorching cost.
I scream into the sky, no answers to be found,
My final strand is unlocked in rage, I stand my ground.

Falling downwards, I'm embracing my fate,
Falling downwards, into a darkened place,
Falling downwards, I'm being dragged into the abyss,

Stillborn dreams of a future that won't come 
Drifting in the dark, crescendos of despair 
An army of the damned, ready to march 

Beneath the veil of false salvation 
Incapable of seeing the truth

This is the prison of our bleak reality 

Living in a world so cold and dark 
Losing hope for the chance of escape 
The only sound we hear is the beating of our hearts 
A reminder of the life we can never break free from

Stuck at a tipping point we never dare exceed 
And what if no one comes to liberate our souls 
And all of this is all there is to make us whole

The world it seems has already moved on 
All that's left is our broken faith 
And an eternity of utter desolation

Driven by fear, cursed to never forget

Chilled by the ache of a lifetime of pain

Stuck at a tipping point we never dare exceed
And what if no one comes to liberate our souls

The moonlight our only hope, our only light
Haunted by memories of a past we cannot change
The future remains a mystery, hidden from our range

Beyond the pain and the sorrow, too strong to fall
A lifetime of pain and suffering, this is my final call
This weight of despair and agony, no more I can bear

" dead

Darkness falls around me, my eyes are blind and cold
My body shakes in terror, my world begins to unfold
My soul is encased in fear, no refuge from this dread
My cries for help echo in vain, no ear to hear my pleas

No solace in the silence, no comfort in the night
The emptiness inside of me, an eternal plight
My limbs are wracked with pain, like I'm boiling from inside
The pain so overpowering, it fills me with pride

Fear memories are all that lie ahead 
Never have I felt so lost
Fear tragedy is all that lies ahead 
Never have I felt so dead

My breath quickens, my heart racing, my faith slowly slips away
Despair creeps in, no light shines, I'm filled with dread and dismay
No way out of this prison, my hopes dashed on the ground
Stripped of all I yearned for, my last breath makes a sound

Fear memories are all that lie ahead 
Never have I felt so lost
Fear tragedy is all that lies ahead 
Never have I felt so dead

The darkness takes me, I surrender to its will
My fate sealed, my soul released, free at last to fly away
The pain is gone, I'm free again and my soul starts to heal
I raise my eyes up to the sky, no more fear and no more dread

In a world of pain we resist, no more broken chains
Rise together to reach the skies, never again we'll hide
The hunger in our hearts and souls, no chance of surcease
Only courage can grant us release, our only true release

Let the fire burst forth and fill up the night
No one left to blame, no more games to play
Reach for the truth and past the lies

Feel it tonight, the all-embracing power
Lead us away from the wicked hour
Despair will no longer prevail, no one's left to suffer and fail
Step into the light, no time to be denied

Feel it, the other shore, why can't I reach it tonight?
Feel it, it's all so pointless, time has come to pay the price
Feel it, and I know there's more truth to this life,
There's more than this, look up to the sky and make it right.",metal

My ambition and my courage, crashing like a broken song
My fate is sealed, my final battle's here, I will fight and die with pride
My heart is strong, I'm ready to take on what fate will decide

Once I was strong, but now I'm weak, I'm ready to face my fears
My soul's aflame, but I'm doomed to fail, my strength is lost in tears
The clock is ticking, I'm ready to go, I'm ready to face the night
Shields up, swords drawn, I'll stand my ground, with courage burning bright

I've wasted my good fortune, my body and my mind
I'll have to go in with nothing but bullets and my pride
And I know all this has changed me, how long will I still have to wait?
How long will it take to get there, how long will this all take?
What happens after we get there?

My loyalty can never be questioned, my courage will never waiver
My blood runs cold as I march forward, one final stand, no surrender
Whatever awaits me, I'm ready, I will keep my faith alive
Take hold of my destiny, I will never let it die

Surrounded by dark and evil forces,
I awaken in a trance,
My body aching, bloodied and sore,
The chains preventing me from advancing.
The torturer's whip comes crossing down,
A foul and menacing sound,
I cannot resist the agonizing pain
No matter how hard I try.

My face is battered and bruised,
The wounds he inflicted cut deep,
My screams of anguish sound out in the night,
The terror he induces runs deep.

Compulsive cruelty his sadistic urge,
A cruel symphony of screams he does purvey,
My soul in tatters, my hope drained away,
As I plead for my end to this wretched day.

The tools of torture he wields with disdain,
His wickedness unyielding, no respite from the pain,
The drill pierces my skin, acid burning my veins,
My organs fried, I can no longer remain.

Compulsive cruelty my body's a canvas for his urge,
A sick mind emerges in this desperate time of need,
To God I will turn, may his flesh in Hell forever burn,
No more can I bear, this must be the end of me.

The darkness in his eyes
The malice in his grasp,
Nothing can save me
The evil has taken its last gasp.

Compulsive cruelty my body's a canvas for his urge,
A sick mind emerges in this desperate time of need,
To God I will turn, may his flesh in Hell forever burn,
On this final night, my torture I must finally heed.",metal

Rise from my ashes, display their dismay 
A death of a loved one, life fading away 
Only darkness remains, no hope to shine 
Mourning in silence, this cross I must bear

Stealing the air from my lungs, choking me where I stand

Burning alive, no escape from the flames

Lost in a cycle of darkness and despair
We stand in line outside false prophets' gates
Waiting for salvation beyond the thin veil of fate

Our faith and hope is corroded by their lies
We are their victims their prey in disguise
Voices in our head speak of a better tomorrow
But nothing changes we still live in sorrow

We are the ghosts, condemned to roam the night
Searching for a way to break these chains of fright
Yearning for freedom, living in a cell of doubt
We are empty shells, a chance to be found out

Lies, deceptions, and a lack of truth
We stand in judgment before our youth
Living in peril, never finding peace
Our lives have been stolen, we cannot flee

In a world of shadows, shadows of the night
We stand in limbo with no end in sight
Our wounds so deep, our souls so cold
Can we find the strength the confidence to be bold?

We are the living ghosts, waiting to be freed
Stuck at a tipping point, hoping to succeed
Is there someone to come and answer our plea
And give us hope and show us what it means to be free?",metal

We journey through life with no direction
Spirits are broken with no redemption
We roam these depths searching for a cure
A light to guide us with no assurance

What lies within is tough

From our despair we hear the call
A thunderous voice that leaves us in awe
As we stare doom in the face
Our will to fight is all that remains

Stuck at a tipping point with no way to proceed
And what if no one comes to liberate our souls
Is this all there is for us to console?

Answers are few and consequences are bleak
We live in a culture filled with hypocrisy 
From deep within, voices of doubt arise
The future's uncertain with no compromise

We can't escape from this mortal coil
God has forsaken us to our own toil
We've reached a fork in the road so grim
Do we rise up or give in?

We do not know what awaits us
We must take a chance and plunge into the abyss
And as we cut our way through this darkness
We find a way to survive with no bliss

Are we just living ghosts waiting to be freed
Stuck at a tipping point with no way to proceed
And what if no one comes to liberate our souls

We break through the chains of despair
Unleashing a rage no one can compare
Lightning strikes and the skies turn black
We are on our own, make no mistake

Our scars will heal and our strength will grow
No longer will we feel such sorrow
Fate is in our hands, this we can see
And what we build will last eternally

Stuck at a tipping point we dare exceed

": music: oscar simon lyrics: oscar simon

We're running out of time and we're out of breath
Our world's a fading hell and we're in a state of unrest
It's our own damn fault, we let it come this far
The lifeblood of our days just oozes from our scars

Ending up alone just like those before us
The past of failure haunts us, still nobody hears us
We've reached the point of no return, with no direction we move on
It seems like it's too late as we all become undone

We're broken and ruthless and what can be lost
It's the will of being expected and all hope is tossed
We're faceless and soulless, born to live as pawns
On a chessboard of deceit, where our fate is drawn

We've lost our voice in the distance, we can't even hear ourselves
And no one around us can tell the truth from the lies
We can't find the answers, only more questions arise
Our hearts are aching and our souls are caged in by the lies

We can't find what we have missed and we can't break our legs again
Our dreams are shattered, our hearts are cold and our souls are in pain
We can't brace our hearts again, but still we march on towards the dawn
And hope is just a spark, though too weak to carry on",metal

It's so hard to detach from the ones I love true 
The evolution of life, even if it takes a few 
I'm breaking free from the physical, my soul will never be gone 

Verse 2
Painful as it is, I know what I must do 
I'm gonna move on, so I can soar and take flight 
The world has opened my eyes, I'm starting to view 
A new way of living, no chains and no strife 

Chorus 
Letting go of that past, I'm embracing what's new 
It's so hard to detach from the ones I love true 
The evolution of life, even if it takes a few 
I'm breaking free from the physical, my soul will never be gone 

Bridge 
Breaking through this mortal veil, I'm leaving it all behind 
There's nothing here to quell my pain, I'm breaking out of my mind 
Into a world that doesn't judge, my worries have all gone away 
I'm free from the chains that bound me, so I can step into the fray 

Chorus 
Letting go of that past, I'm embracing what's new 
It's so hard to detach from the ones I love true 
The evolution of life, even if it takes a few 
I'm breaking free from the physical, my soul will never be gone 
My soul will never be gone",metal

Verse 1:
I rise up, the sun is about to set
My music's turned up, but my thoughts are so quiet yet
I'm in a metal state, my anger is on full blast
My music is my escape, but this feels like a sorry last

Chorus:
I don't wanna live in the real world
This broken system's been taking its toll
So many lies and deceit, they want to break my will
I don't wanna live in the real world

Verse 2:
From the riots in the street, broken families and broken dreams
This world's an ugly place, nothing like it seems
Danger lurking around every corner, shadows we can't escape
The government only cares about money, they won't change their ways

Chorus:
I don't wanna live in the real world
This broken system's been taking its toll
So many lies and deceit, they want to break my will
I don't wanna live in the real world

Bridge:
But I won't give in, I'll keep on fighting
I won't back down, won't stay down for long
I'll keep on rising, won't take the easy way out
I don't wanna live in the real world

Chorus:
I don't wanna live in the real world
This broken system's been taking its toll
So many lies and deceit, they want to break my will
I don't wanna live in the real world

Verse 1:
Flee the night in a panic state,
Plastic shields block the raging hate.
Letting go as we spiral down,
Hiding from the global sound.

Chorus: 
I don't wanna live in the real world, 
Where doom and gloom are unfurled. 
Curse the loathing held inside, 
Those thoughts I can no longer hide.

Verse 2: 
Shadowed by the elites plan, 
Savior of the sighted man. 
Can't believe the way we are, 
Unleashing fury from afar.

Chorus: 
I don't wanna live in the real world, 
Where the blind lead the blind. 
All these lies corroded my soul, 
Pleading for a way to be whole.

Verse 3: 
Escape the mass control,
Abandon this crushing toll. 
The shackles of oppression are loosed, 
Lost in a realm of abuse. 

Chorus: 
I don't wanna live in the real world, 
Where it's survival of the fittest. 
No more sorrow or shame, 
Fly away to a place of no blame. 

Outro: 
I don't wanna live in the real world, 
Where days are never done. 
No more waiting around, 
Freedom will be found.",metal

Verse 1:
The lies we spoke, so hard to see
A sense of pride that's clearly empty
Carrying false hope, no way out
A broken soul, becoming loud

Chorus:
This is the way we've been deceived
Living as one, no one believes
The walking dead, living a lie
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?

Verse 2:
The bonds we made, broken apart
Destroying the ones that held you close
Tired from the battles we've lost
Deception only brings destruction

Chorus:
This is the way we've been deceived
Living as one, no one believes

Searching for solidarity, we turn it down
Our legacy of brutality, try to destroy
Striving for perfection, misery only brings joy

Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?",metal

Chorus 
Living in a world full of rage and despair,
No more truth just lies in the air.
No escape, it's too late, we've been deceived,
Leading our lives as the walking dead.

Verse 1
Forsaken our souls searching for a place to hide,
Broken minds begging for a way to survive.
Cutthroat tactics and backstabbed by our own,
No road signs in this desolate zone.

Verse 2
Drowning in despair and in darkness we find,
Battles waging and our thoughts so unkind.
Lives shattered, no hope for the future's embrace,
The only way out is to accept our fate.

Bridge
So doomed to watch our dreams come undone,
Our hopeless emotions overrun.
Crying out in frustration and pain,
We lead our lives as the walking dead.

Chorus 
Living in a world full of rage and despair,
No more truth just lies in the air.
No escape, it's too late, we've been deceived,
Leading our lives as the walking dead.",metal
