To follow the Reaper till the point of no return

Grab a bottle to drink up the pain relieving potion

We can choose our own fate and live by our own creed
Moving forward with courage, never looking back in need
We have been brought together in this fight
And we will keep winning with all of our might

Chorus:
Our strength will never break, we will never fall
Our love will stay awake, through it all
No matter what comes our way, we will still be strong
We will find our way, knowing right from wrong

Outro:
Through each trial, we are made stronger
We are united, ready to stand much longer
Our faith will guide us and lead us ahead
We will be victorious, until the very end",metal

Verse 1:
My mind is a prison, my heart's colder than ice,
Believing in nothing, engulfed in the night,
My life's taken its toll, I'm living in despair,
Searching for refuge but nothing is there.

Chorus:
Hear all my secrets, tell all the lies,
Hear all my secrets, tell all the fucking lies,
Can you hear it scream deep deep inside,
Envy, sloth, gluttony, wrath, pride, lust, greed.

Verse 2:
These secrets I'll bring to you are of thorns and ice,
These secrets I'll give to you will turn virtue to vice,
I'll tell you only once, don't you dare make a sound,
A sorrowful truth that will never be found.

Chorus:
Hear all my secrets, tell all the lies,
Hear all my secrets, tell all the fucking lies,
Can you hear it scream deep deep inside,
Envy, sloth, gluttony, wrath, pride, lust, greed.

Bridge:
Hush, don't tell them nothing, not a word,
Hush, don't tell them nothing, not a single thing that I've said to you,
Hear all my secrets, tell all the lies,
Hear all my secrets, tell all the fucking lies.

Chorus:
Hear all my secrets, tell all the lies,
Hear all my secrets, tell all the fucking lies,
Can you hear it scream deep deep inside,
Envy, sloth, gluttony, wrath, pride, lust, greed.",metal
" saved for me back in the room no space for the repetition im fucking done with you

Verse 1
My head is filled with pain and fear
It's time to let go of the past
My life is my own, no one can take it away
Let the memories fade away

Chorus
No headspace saved for me
Back in the room, no space for the repetition
I'm fucking done with you
The way you crawl into my brain makes me fucking get out

Verse 2
My soul is locked in a box of misery
I'm ready to break out of this state
My heart of stone ain't strong enough
To withstand the power of this beat

Chorus
No headspace saved for me
Back in the room, no space for the repetition
I'm fucking done with you
The way you crawl into my brain makes me fucking get out

Bridge
My mind is aching and spinning out of control
The darkness I faced, I'm ready to let go
My sanity starts to slip away in the night
But I'll fight the demons and make it alright

Chorus
No headspace saved for me
Back in the room, no space for the repetition
I'm fucking done with you
The way you crawl into my brain makes me fucking get out",metal
