Grab a bottle to drink up the pain relieving potion

Believing in nothing, engulfed in the night,
My life's taken its toll, I'm living in despair,
Searching for refuge but nothing is there.

These secrets I'll give to you will turn virtue to vice,

A sorrowful truth that will never be found.

Abuse of power, corruption you'll soon know
Bury justice in the dirt, no one's there to free us
It's part of this broken game, these lies they'll never see us

Chorus 1:
Take us, blind us, tie us up, drown us in the dark, oblivious
Scars are your grand work of art, we cannot fight
We're reaching out, two hands, searching for solace in vain
An illusion, a play, nothing left to retain

Verse 2:
Take it at face value don't get a means to an end
A dishonorable oath to serve and protect the hand that feeds
Drops harder as time passes by, a power trip fueled by mass control
Criminals, a badge won't justify, reaching excuses, marks oblivious

Chorus 2:
Man blind and corrupt, opinions you've got no leg to stand
Deny and oppress, you don't know that it's wrong
Blur the lines, we're quick to put the blame on minority lives
To justify the end of authorities crime

Outro:

Rage of the Beast

You create the pain, the agony you suffer
Playing with fire, the flames will never die
The hatred that you feel, you can't ignore it
You take it out on me, like I'm the enemy

Rage of the beast, inside of you swelling
Consuming every thought and crippling your core
You're too blind to see, or too scared to accept
That I know the truth, this is your own fault

Constant sorrow, is no way to live
The empty void, that you can never fill
Your vicious temper, it never lets up
It will consume you, until you have enough

Rage of the beast is the path you follow
Afraid of the sunlight, you will forever wallow
In your own despair, in your own soul brew
Your own lies, you will forever rue

Living in darkness, where only misery lies
You can't escape, from your own demise
Your own suffering, you try to deny it
But it will eat away, every reason you ever had

Rage of the beast, where darkness is king
You can't repress it, it's your everything
Face your terror, you know what it means
To find the courage, and break free from the chains.",metal

I try to make it through the chaos
But it's an uphill battle that I fight
I'm consuming every inch of this madness
Trying to keep alive what's left of the light
So in the midst of this war going on
I won't let go of my beliefs
I'm ready to face what's coming
Until death do us part, united we'll stand

Chorus
We are nothing like these creatures
Guilty and scarred from what we've done
The price of our pride is too high
We'll feed our own selfishness
We are nothing like these creatures
Guilty and scarred from what we've done
The price of our pride is too high
We'll let the bastards surround us

The diseased and dying have no hope
There is no peace in violence

So many have suffered and the cries cannot be denied.

Forced to accept the plague of corruption rising like a sand.

The truth is hidden and the lies are prevailing.
No justice for the innocent who've been taken away,
The darkness overpowers and the faith starts to fade.

Only by uniting, can we rise up against the deadly frost.

In a never-ending cycle of pain and despair

Never thought that I could be so lost in my own despair,
Living in a world that constantly wears me down.
Drowning in a sea of rage, no one around to hear me scream,
I feel like I'm in a prison, a living hell that's never serene.

As I fly on my own, I'm free to explore my thoughts,
Wandering in a place I've never been before.
Away from the pain and suffering, a life I no longer dread,
Closing my eyes and hold my breath 'til I'm no more.

My heart still beats like a drum, will it ever find its way?
Shadows pass me by in my journey to find a brighter day.
Caught in the darkness, lost in the endless night,
Wide awake and stare up to the sky in search of the light.

As I fly on my own, I'm free to explore my thoughts,
Wandering in a place I've never been before.
Away from the pain and suffering, a life I no longer dread,
Closing my eyes and hold my breath 'til I'm no more.

Though I feel that I'm alone, I know that's not the case,
For I am surrounded by friends I can't see but embrace.
Lost in my own world, the fear and the doubt,
I'm ready to take the plunge and free myself from the rout.

Standing in the shadows I'm feeling so alone
Stranded in a world I can't escape on my own
The guilt it constantly gnaws inside of me
It's eating me alive, I'm a walking tragedy

My hands on the wheel, I'm desperately hoping
That soon I'll be free from this sorrowful abyss
The light that I seek, can I find it in this

As we fly on our own, hopelessness 
Overpowers me as I try to find home 
The struggles of life, don't go unseen 
My broken wings, I can't break free

I'm walking on a tightrope, fighting until the end 
The demons in my mind, I must defend 
The days are getting longer, and the nights darker still 
The weight of my guilt, it's a constant chill 
I'm locked in an endless cycle, a cycle of despair 
A realm of shadows, with no one there
The fight I must fight, I just can't win 
I'm lost in the dark, with no sign of my sin

Chorus:
As we fly on our own, hopelessness 
Overpowers me as I try to find home 
The struggles of life, don't go unseen 
My broken wings, I can't break free

As I finally accept this, this is my fate
Falling through the darkness, I must face it on my own
My soul's in a prison, I'm a prisoner of my own mind
Now I'm screaming my pain, as I'm losing my time

As we fly on our own, hopelessness 
Overpowers me as I try to find home 
The struggles of life, don't go unseen

Falling in the void, I will never be the same

I'm watching the fire burn all around me,
This prison of misery is closing in,
Chained to my hell all I can do is scream,
But I'm not giving in!

Screaming through the night my soul is searching,
Ripping my skin apart, I feel the thirst,
I'll take this broken bone and use it as a sword,
My revenge is coming first!

You brought me to this place and I won't die here,
I can feel the power inside,
And with a heavy heart I'm now reclaiming my life,
As I cut off the binds! 

Chorus:
Cutting through my pain I will no longer remain,
I'll take my broken wings and fly,
The strength to face this fight comes from deep inside,
I will never die!

Tear it down, break loose these walls,
I'm shaking off the fear,
No more will I be fooled by your deceiving ways,
Go on and disappear!

Nothing left to stop me now,
I'm burning all the lies,
I'm taking back my life and I won't look back,
You've been erased from my life!

Chorus:
Cutting through my pain I will no longer remain,
I'll take my broken wings and fly,
The strength to face this fight comes from deep inside,
I will never die!

So as I make my way through these ashes,
I'm watching them all burn and fade away,
The fire gives me strength and I'm no longer bound,
This freedom is here to stay!

Chorus:
Cutting through my pain I will no longer remain,
I'll take my broken wings and fly,
The strength to face this fight comes from deep inside,
I will never die, I will never die!",metal

Verse 1:
I'm feeling the pain, tearing my heart in two
Dragged down by the weight of the noose, I'm stuck in this ghost of you
My sanity's slipping away, I'm struggling to stay afloat
I feel the rope tightening, I won't be crushed by your throat

Chorus:
I've cut you out, set me free
Lynched high above what used to be
In your gallows, built for me
I escaped, I broke free

My faith has been tested like never before

A heartache that doesn't seem to subside

A reminder of what we've lost that night
A broken heartache that won't go away
I'm left behind in constant dismay

Someone wake me when it's over

A tragedy, nothing can explain
The cost of one life, so much pain
You should have been here, living life to the fullest
But I'm stuck in the memories of those moments we had

Someone wake me when it's over

Evil lurks behind every door

The darkness of your lies
Ain't no reason to deny
A broken heart and broken dreams
You'll never hear me scream
No more lies you've said
My love for you is dead

The fire within my veins is gone

Your lies just seem to haunt me
Now it's time I face the truth
Alone it's where I've been for you

Fading away my shattered soul,

Raining down my despair,
Climbing up from the darkest hole,
No hope anywhere.

Gonna stand tall and never give in.

Time to move forward no more pain,
A brand new start is what I need,
Time to take my life back again.

I'll make my own choices and stand on my own,
Time to write my own destiny,
No more living in the shadows,
Gonna find my peace and be set free.

Roaming through the stellar fields, a new beginning is what we claim 
We're blowing off on this ouroboran wind and never coming down 
Never again fall back into this abysmal ground

We all fade away into the grey, a place so familiar to us all 
The chill of the night, won't let us forget the past that we must recall 
What world awaits us when this one is drab and desolate 
What fate awaits us when the walls are drained and vacant 

Elevate yourself to the sun, incinerate and let the ashes reign 
Roaming through the stellar fields, a new beginning is what we claim 
From the ashes of despair a new day shall rise 
Our suffering remains fade away as our new end starts to align 

Stay away from the old ways, starting over and never look back 
Stay away from the betrayal, let the truth be what we track 
Elevate yourself to the sun, incinerate and let the ashes rain

We are born anew in a world of our own
We stand unified and with strength we now grow
No more suffering, our future is our own

We've been fighting for too long
To see our old ways undone
A new dawn is here, we are finally free
Rising from the ashes, a new seed we will sow

Rise up with us, brothers and sisters
As we start again, fresh and strong
No longer will we be shackled by fear
Let us bring in the dawn of a new song

Embrace the future, together we will stand
No more pain and suffering in our land
This is a new beginning for all of us here
Come join us and let us be reborn

Rise up, raise our voices
A new age of harmony and peace
No more sorrow and no more pain
A world of hope, where joy never fades

A new life we will now create
All of us unified and strong, we will never break
Soar into the sky, and let our spirits fly
The past is over, this is a new dawn of life",metal

" so tell me how it should be

Fading memories linger within me
Like a disease no one can see
Stumbling through the shadows of the night
Can't help but feel so dismayed

My soul is so empty, left in despair
So I scream out in rage
Feeling this pain inside my veins
As I try to escape these chains

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I'm searching for a way to find solace
In this world of constant pain

Can't let another page burn away
I search for a reason to stay
I'm desperate to find a way out
But I can't seem to find a way

I don't want to die for anyone
I can't bear this pain for so long
No one here can understand
What I've become

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I'm searching for a way to find solace
In this world of constant pain

Can't let another page burn away
I search for a way to stay alive

But I can't seem to find a way

My struggles keep dragging me down
All I can do is keep on searching
For solace inside this pain",metal
" so tell me how it should be

I can feel the fires burning, as I'm consumed in rage,
Searching for solace, in a world gone insane,
My misery unfolding, warping in these flames,
I've nowhere to turn, nothing can remain.

I'm pushed to the limit, a prisoner of fear,
Cursed with this boundary, no hope is here,
Time to face my demons, what lies beneath,
There's no way out, I won't be relieved.

Something's getting in the way, something's closing in,
My fate will be written, in the book of sin,
I'll search for redemption, and find again,
Guide me down this path, 'till I'm set free from pain.

Desperate I will crawl, waiting for so long,
No love here is no love, death for anyone.
What have I become, as I try to break free,
Held captive by chains, an eternity.

Something's getting in the way, something's just about to break,
I will try to find my way, will I ever escape?
Burning and rage fills me, my soul is in despair,
Unable to break the chains, and find what's out there.

I'm ready to take the chance, and face my destiny,
No help I shall receive, I will fix my own calamity,
Standing tall and brave, trying to conquer this land,
So tell me how it should be, will I ever understand?",metal

Walking in a dreary state of mind,
The city is lost, as I am standing still,
Unfriendly sidewalks, streetlights faintly glow,
My palm pressed against the dead cold iron pole.

Thoughts navigate the grey density all around,
Hiding in the confinement of a filthy back alley,
Swallowed up by darkness, the city's losing tally.

Coughing out of habit, though I've never smoked,
Passing giants of manmade desires,
Spreading their wings of darkness for miles.

The air's thick with the scent of cigarettes and liquor on my breath.

Verse 1 
Unnatural, it's in my soul, 
This life I never chose, 
It's like a contractual piece of my heart I signed away, 
To get these magic beans and make my dreams come true, 
Open your eyes and see what's happened to you. 

Chorus 
Unnaturally this comes to me, 
Can't seem to find someone to be, 
It's so laughable, I give myself away, 
Aretha knows which way for me to go, 
Open her heart, it blows me away, 
Led by a king, told her to sing, so naturally, her lucky day.  

Verse 2 
Unnatural, still in my heart, 
Dumb luck gave her everything she has, 
Dumb luck breeds jealousy, 
Stuck in a body with these hands, 
Convinced I couldn't be, couldn't be. 

Chorus 
Unnaturally this comes to me, 
Can't seem to find someone to be, 
It's so laughable, I give myself away,

" watch it collapse

Driven faster to the nothingness, 
No control locked in this mess. 
Spinning madly on this wheel of fate,
Our souls doomed to this hateful state.

Chorus:
Show the way point to nothing,
Show the way profit from loss. 
Time is space ticking slow decay,
Ascend across love percolates.

Drowned in sin condemning us all,
Bearing the cross our hearts take the fall.
Marching forward to an unseen fate,
As our masks begin to break.

Chorus:
Fill up the cup or pour out the shame,
The candlelight burns the room to ash and dust.
Clone the same light the flame,
Prove that this sham will save me.

Bridge:
Heal the thirst of knowledge, 
Turn a blind eye forward,
Good things come to those who wait,
Always over compensate.

Chorus:
Watching the blood percolate, 
Hide the keys within their faith.
Hide within the shadow,
Brainwashed into who you trust.

Your lungs filled with ash and dust, 
Take that final breath,
Brainwashed into who you trust,
Hide within the shadow. 

Secular forbidden thoughts,
Put them underground,
Smother them from life,
Always unforgiven.

Enslave all the living, 
Your lungs filled with ash and dust,
Put them underground,
Smother them from life. 

Outro:
Good things come to those who wait, 
Constant sleep watch it collapse. 
Watch shit collapse, 
Watch it collapse, 
Watch shit collapse.",metal

Body and soul collided in a frenzied mayhem 
I look out through the night to the stars in the sky 
My only thought - this delirium won't let me die

A mixture of fear and rage, I am my own worst enemy

Desperation is pulling me further down 
My strength fades away like the sun setting in the afternoon 
It's time to stand up and fight off this delirium

Body and soul collided in a frenzied mayhem

My fears want control and I'm feeling so alone

Can you hear me call through the night?
Staring out into the darkness, no one in sight
A pale semblance of what was once inside
The shame and the guilt that runs deep and wide

Who could call my name without regretting?
Who could see beyond this my darkness and
For once save their own prayers?
Who could mirror down just a little of their sun?

Struggling to break through the cycles I can't survive
My darkness so deep, I cannot see the light
Can't save myself, so I'm begging for the fight

Who could see beyond this my darkness and
For once save their own prayers?

Would anyone follow me further down?

I'm engulfed in darkness, surrounded by pain, 
My mind likes to wander, my body's a slave. 
My life has been compromised, I'm living in constant strife,
I try to surpass my limits, but I'm living a lie.

I'm on a path of destruction, I'm following a dead end,

Verse 1
Under the weight of this pain, you can’t take but one more step
Your eyes are shut, hatred lurks but you can’t let go just yet
There’s a voice in the back of your mind, screaming out for a change
You can’t break free from the chains, you’re trapped in this cage

Chorus
Open your eyes and see, you are the master of your destiny
Let go of the pain, too scared to take a chance
Break free from these walls, believe in yourself, take a stand
Open up your eyes, you can be the one
There’s so much more to see, now you can be the one

Verse 2
Trapped in a world of despair, with nowhere to go
Your hands are tied, no one to hear your cries, no one to show
You’ve held onto the darkness, letting it win every fight
But now it’s time to rise up and break free from these chains of night

Chorus
Open your eyes and see, you are the master of your destiny
Let go of the pain, too scared to take a chance
Break free from these walls, believe in yourself, take a stand

Open your eyes and see, you are the master of your destiny

This world, a cold and hostile place, 
A broken dream and burning rage 
Forced to take a stand and fight, 
We won't accept a wrong or a lie 

The pain of life, the tears we cry,
The darkness that consumes our minds 
We see the truth and find a way,
To make our own escape from this world

In a world of lies and broken dreams,
We stand together in defiance 
No matter how hard they try, 
We will never succumb to the night

We're fighting for something more than life, 
Rise up, arise and take the fight 
Take up the sword and never back down,
For justice, freedom and our rights 

The fight is on, there's something more,
A purpose and a way to soar 
We raise our fists and stand with pride, 
Our enemies will never take us alive

Our voices echo through the night, 
We will never surrender the fight 
It's time to take control, 
Rise up, arise and break the mold

Is it life around me, or am I fucked in the head?

I'm sick of your stupid lies, you tell us it's ok 
Life seems at an end, death is on your back 
Ronnie and his generals just sit back and laugh 
Time for you to act now, and make one final stand 
There is no alternative, your life is in your hands 

You think that you're the only one
To solve your problems with a gun 
Does it make you feel like a man 
To take a life in your hands?
