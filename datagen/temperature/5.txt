Verse 1
I got my first pickup when I was just a boy
I drove it all around, never made a noise
Hauled hay bales and fence posts, felt like a king
And I'd take all the girls for a spin in the spring

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe de Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my loves in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 2
I took my truck to the drive-in show
The cargo light gave off a romantic glow
Never had to wait in line for the popcorn stand
Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe de Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my loves in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Bridge
A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe de Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my loves in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah there's something women like about a pickup man
