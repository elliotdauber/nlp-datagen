Verse 1
I got my first truck when I was just a kid
I drove it 'round the county, never did get sick
I hauled hay bales and logs, and thought twice before I hauled a pretty girl's prom dress to the dance floor
She tried to pay me with a kiss, and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 2
Most Friday nights I can be found in the bed of my truck
On an old chaise lounge, backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 3
A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah, there's something women like about a pickup man
