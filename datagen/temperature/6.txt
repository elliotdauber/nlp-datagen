Verse 1
I was born a country boy, with a heart of gold
I had an old pickup truck that I drove all around my home
The county roads, they stretched for miles, the wind in my hair
I was livin' life the way I wanted, without a single care

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 2
I took my pickup truck out for a spin, just to clear my head
I drove around for hours, the windows rolled down instead
The sun was setting in the sky, when I saw a pretty face
She was standing by the side of the road, with a smile and a wave

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 3
She hopped right in and said, "Take me for a ride"
We drove around for hours, just taking in the sights
We talked and laughed and shared our dreams, it felt like a movie scene
And I knew right then, this girl was meant for me

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah, there's something women like about a pickup man
