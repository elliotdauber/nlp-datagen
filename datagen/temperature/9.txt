Verse 1
I was born in a truck town, where you had to earn your stripes
Growin' up I was runnin' around, in my daddy's old beater truck
I'd head out for open roads, coastin' through the Texas night
With the windows rolled down, music on loud, livin' my life

Chorus
Gotta big ol' heart, but a little rust in the seams
When push comes to shove, I can make 'em dream
There's something special 'bout a pickup man
Ain't nothin' like a truck that can, breakin' the mold, truckin' like a pro
There's something all the ladies love, 'bout a pickup man

Verse 2
Old Jeb, taught me all he could, of the roads and the open lands
We'd head out with a full load, never gonna miss the chance
He said, look here son, you take my truck and drive
It's a way of life and a way to survive, so that's what I did

Chorus
Gotta big ol' heart, but a little rust in the seams
When push comes to shove, I can make 'em dream
There's something special 'bout a pickup man
Ain't nothin' like a truck that can, breakin' the mold, truckin' like a pro
There's something all the ladies love, 'bout a pickup man

Bridge
Workin' hard, livin' the dream
Climbing hills, over streams
Always the same, never change
Me and my truck, we'll never part
Runnin' around from dusk to dawn
Singin' songs, through the night
Gettin' lost, and makin' it right

Chorus
Gotta big ol' heart, but a little rust in the seams
When push comes to shove, I can make 'em dream
There's something special 'bout a pickup man
Ain't nothin' like a truck that can, breakin' the mold, truckin' like a pro
There's something all the ladies love, 'bout a pickup man
