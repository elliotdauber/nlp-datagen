Verse 1
I got my first truck when I was just a kid
I drove it 'round the county, never did get sick
Hauled hay bales and logs, and thought twice before
I hauled a load of furniture for the girl next door

Chorus
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

Verse 2
When I turned sixteen I saved a few bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruisin' the town and the first girl I seen
Was a pretty little thing, name of Mary Jean

Chorus
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, "I never knew you were a pickup man"
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 3
Most Friday nights I can be found in the bed of my truck
On an old chaise lounge, backed into my spot
At the drive-in show, a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand

Chorus
Cause there's something women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah, there's something women like about a pickup man
