Verse 1:
I got my first truck when I was just a kid,
Drivin' around town with my buddies in the backseat,
Haulin' hay bales and dirt and rocks,
And I knew I'd never be the same when I saw that girl next door.

Chorus:
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand,
There's something women like about a pickup man,
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill,
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville.

Verse 2:
When I turned sixteen I saved up a few bucks,
My first car was a pickup truck,
Cruisin' around town with the top down,
The first girl I saw was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen.

Chorus:
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab and said,
I never knew you were a pickup man,
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill,
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville.

Verse 3:
Most Friday nights I can be found in the bed of my truck,
On an old chaise lounge backed into my spot at the drive in show,
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow,
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand.

Chorus:
Cause there's something women like about a pickup man,
A bucket of rust or a brand new machine,
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean,
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill,
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville.

Bridge:
I met all my wives in traffic jams,
There's just something women like about a pickup man,
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill,
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville.

Chorus:
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made,
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates,
I met all my wives in traffic jams,
There's just something women like about a pickup man,
Yeah there's something women like about a pickup man.
