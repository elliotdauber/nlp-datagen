Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill 
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made 
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates 
I met all my wives in traffic jams 
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 1 
I was riding down the interstate in my pickup truck 
That's when I saw the prettiest lady I ever had seen and my heart was struck 
She said, "You must be a pickup man to be driving that kind of truck around" 
I just smiled at her and I said "Now that's a matter of opinion, it was truck or bust for me and them boys in town"

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill 
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made 
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates 
I met all my wives in traffic jams 
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 2 
I took her for a ride down an old dusty dirt road 
We talked and we laughed, there ain't never a dull moment in my truck or my life I'm proud to show 
We drove into the sunset and stopped to watch the stars at night 
She hugged me tight and said, "this must be the sweetest ride I've ever had in my life"

Chorus
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill 
And I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe de ville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made 
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates 
I met all my wives in traffic jams 
There's just something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill

You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates 
I met all my wives in traffic jams 
There's just something women like about a pickup man
