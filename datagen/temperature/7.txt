Verse 1
I was born in the country, saw my first wild deer
Learned to drive when I was barely ten in my Daddy's old truck gear
My first love was a sweet country girl, she said I'd be her man
The day I drove her off in my pickup, I knew I'd never be the same

Chorus
You can put my truck in a spin, send it rollin' down a hill
I'd never trade it for a coupe de ville, it's my will and my thrill
I got an eight foot bed that's never been made
If it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my loves in traffic jams, there's just something 'bout a pickup man

Verse 2
I took my truck out to the woods, where I'd go to get away
I'd sit up in the bed and howl at the moon, the stars were my only company
I'd watch the sun go down in the sky, I'd never felt so alive
Then I'd fire up the engine and cruise on home, it was the life I'd always strive

Chorus
You can put my truck in a spin, send it rollin' down a hill
I'd never trade it for a coupe de ville, it's my will and my thrill
I got an eight foot bed that's never been made
If it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my loves in traffic jams, there's just something 'bout a pickup man

Bridge
I know I'll never be the same, I'm a pickup man at heart
I still feel the same, it's a part of me and I can't change

Chorus
You can put my truck in a spin, send it rollin' down a hill
I'd never trade it for a coupe de ville, it's my will and my thrill
I got an eight foot bed that's never been made
If it weren't for trucks, we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my loves in traffic jams, there's just something 'bout a pickup man
Yeah, there's something 'bout a pickup man
