Verse 1
Well I got my first truck when I was just a tyke
Sixteen when I got my own, a little Ford pick-up that I could ride
It wasn't much to look at but it took me everywhere
My momma said I'd meet a girl when I got behind the wheel

Chorus
There's something women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe Deville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
If it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 2
Spent my last dime on some new chrome
Took her to the drive-in to watch a movie at home
She said, "I never knew you were a pickup man"
I said, "Ride with me and you'll find out"

Chorus
There's something women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe Deville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
If it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Verse 3
Gonna take my truck and hit the open road
Show the girl of my dreams the cowboy way of life
We'll drive, never settledown and take in the scenery
There's something special about a pickup and me

Chorus
There's something women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
I still wouldn't trade it for a coupe Deville
I got an eight foot bed that never has to be made
If it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah there's something women like about a pickup man
